"status" is what defines a device's state in terms of enabled,
present, available. That's exactly what we're expressing here.

Now, I do not think we should be mixing the device class (e.g.
touchscreen) into status. I said this on v1, but apparently that was
not listened to.

No. That's more or less what v1 had.
