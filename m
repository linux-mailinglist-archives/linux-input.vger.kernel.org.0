I don't think we are ready to enable runtime pm as default for all Intel xHCI controllers.
The risk of xHCI not waking up when user plugs a mouse/keyboard, making the system unusable
just seems too high compared to the powersaving benefit.

The powersaving benefit from autosuspending the TCSS xHCI is a lot better, and we, (Mika mostly)
has been able to verify they work.

So I propose we for now continue adding TCSS xHCI controllers to the allowlist in kernel.
For others I think a userspace allow/denylist makes sense.

Long term goal would be default allow for all, with short denylist in kernel.

Thanks
Mathias
