I think we need to have a parameter `PreferredLineStyle` which can
only take the values from the array above.

If your API provides that, the rest is implementation detail.
Assigning a value to it will by definition invalidate the old value.

Of course this means that the evdev approach is not suited for that,
which makes me think that is probably not the best option.

Right. So you are stripping away the actual meaning, which is report
descriptor dependent.
This is not good because a HW vendor might decide to not order the 6
possible values by their HID usage but put the `No Prefererence` first
for instance. There is also a strong possibility a HW vendor decides
to not rely on the PreferredLineStyleIsLocked and gives a choice of
only one possible value (though that would be mean as this is a per
stylus propriety).

I'll need more clarifications (and getting logs might help me
understand better, yes, please):

I assume this is in the input reports, not in the feature reports.
What happens in the hovering case (not touching)?
Do we get fake values easily identifiable or are they just as normal
as the correct ones?

Anyway, considering the use case, this might not be an issue (I was
re-reading the HUT and this is only an indication for applications).

>

Again, Input reports?
What's in the hovering state reported?
Is the GET_REPORT needed against the feature report or the input report?

>

> (reporting old value) (ELAN)

Am I correct?:

- Pen is hovering/touching
- controller is reporting correct current values in the input reports
(following the 2 cases above)
- host sends a SET_REPORT on the feature
- controller is still sending the old values in the input reports

What happens if you issue a GET_REPORT on the Input?
On the Feature?

>

I assume that's when the stylus is not in proximity, and when you
issue a GET_REPORT of the feature report, not the input, correct?

If so, this is something I would have expected, given that those
properties are per stylus, not per controller.

Well, depending on your answers above, we might have a common set of
cases we can use, or paper over it through bpf if there is a strong
need.

Also, a few more questions:
- have you tried those cases above with the same stylus, or is it HP
controller - HP stylus /  Acer-Acer?
- do these pens have physical notification of the style/width, or do
they just store the data in their memory?
- what are the chromebook models (if I need to eventually expense one)?
- to me, the Goodix report descriptor is bogus in the feature reports.
The Usage Page is stuck at "vendor defined" when it should have been
reset to "Digitizer" before the report ID 9. Is it just me and my
tools or am I missing something?

The more I look at the 2 report descriptors, the more I think that we
should be able to have a common code in hid-input for dealing with
input reports, and then have specifics as bpf programs.
As mentioned earlier, I think Goodix needs a report fixup for the
features, and we might want to change the reported values for Elan
immediately after we issue the config change.

It seems very much that we are in the same situation as Windows 7
multitouch screens. The spec was not restrictive enough that the HW
makers were not very careful, and we added multiple quirks for them.
I would prefer to have a common minimal hid-input handling and defer
the quirks in a BPF program :)

Yeah, I understand it works, it's just that you can not initiate a
bpf_hid_raw_request() call from a raw_event callback. You are in an
IRQ, and we need to run things as fast as possible.
So either we defer, or we find another way of contacting the stylus
outside of the IRQ.

I am thinking of adding a new syscall hid_bpf_run() that the userspace
program can trigger. Otherwise, it seems from a very rough overview we
could hijack the bpf_test_run() syscall, but that would not be very
nice.
Initiating an event from evdev is not very compatible with the BPF
approach because you'll need to also open the evdev node, which you
don't when you run a BPF program.
