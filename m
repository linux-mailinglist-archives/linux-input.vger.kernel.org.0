As explained below, the point here is not to do an internal review to
come up with a final patch that has been signed-off by everybody. The
point is to have a minimum of hand holding when a submission looks
terrible.

We have seen a bunch of (small) patches that have multiple
signed-off-by when they are submitted for the first time, and it's
perfectly fine. It often leads to a fast forward inclusion process.

But in that particular scenario, the patches could have looked less
rude toward the community by having a first internal swipe to say:
- please run checkpatch before submitting
- please use kernel coding style
- please do not send a 9000 loc single patch (it got slightly better
in v3, but still is way too big for anybody to make a correct review
IMO).

And if you prefer to do these things openly, I would have expected
someone from Google to have at least said that publicly.

Basically, what we want is a little bit of mentoring: "can I send this
to the community? - well, there are obvious things that will be a
problem".

The problem is that the form of the very first submission looked
terrible, with a single patch of 9000 changes. It was even rejected by
the mailing list.

I think I understand why this happened, but if that patch is not split
in functional simple logic blocks, there is no way we are going to
review and merge this.

Anyway, many thanks to Krzysztof for trying to review the code, which
I dropped already from v1.

Cheers,
Benjamin
