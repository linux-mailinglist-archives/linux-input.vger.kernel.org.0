Hi Jose,
If there's a chance that the device name is an empty string? In such case=
 the
strlen should be preserved.

>=20Here you coud take advantage of the "ARRAY_SIZE" macro:

>=20
>=20It'll also allow you to use an int. Something similar to:

Thanks for the information!

Thanks again!

Hi Bryan,
Sorry for my inconsiderateness...

It advertises such function:
- FN Function Keys Make Control easily.
FN+F1:My Computer
FN+F2:Browser
FN+F3:Email
...

I made a vital mistake by not properly checking the patch before sending,
that's totally my fault.

Sorry again for the mess I made.

Best wishes,
Chain
