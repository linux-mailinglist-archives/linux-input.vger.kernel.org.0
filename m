Yes, that is the idea.

I agree with you. Thinking about this more, immediately introducing this
feature to the core is a relatively high risk that would be shared by all
users. I like your idea of introducing a preliminary version first before
making heavy-handed changes. That's the beauty of helper functions; they
only impact users who explicitly opt in.

I don't have an immediate use case, but I've been looking at this from
the perspective of a future customer of it. Maybe the right path forward
is as follows:

1. Stick with the same general architecture of v6 and its "limitations",
   which in practice are unlikely to be encountered. I imagine the overlay
   layout you have been using would be the most common use case.
2. Make the handful of small changes that have been suggested thus far.
3. Consider updating patch [4/4] to combine the touchscreen and buttons
   into the same input device as you had in v1. This sets a little simpler
   precedent for the first user of these helpers. If later these helpers
   do get absorbed into the core, thereby forcing a single input device,
   the st1232 would continue to appear the same to user space.

Does this seem reasonable?
