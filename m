Probably not, but there's not really any defined policy there. What
that looks like in DT depends on the component. Displays are a common
one and don't lend well to populating multiple in the DT. For those,
the only solution so far is we require the 2nd source to be compatible
with the default/1st. I think that was QCom chromebooks...

The easy answer is firmware should deal with figuring out what's
actually there and update the DT accordingly.

Shouldn't that just be a case of the driver not screaming if there's no device?

If the config is the same for both we could suppress that warning. If
not the same, seems a bit dangerous to configure the wrong config...
