Apologies for the delay. Given that you received feedbacks from other
folks I wanted things to settle down a little bit before returning to
this discussion. Sorry.

I like the 8th patch of this series much more. If there is a risk of
damaging the device, then we should not have the Kconfig to disable it.

I have some comments on that particular patch (v3 8/10), but I; ll reply
inline.

Benjamin
