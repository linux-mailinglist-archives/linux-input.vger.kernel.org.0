Hi Nikolai,

Thanks a lot for the quick response.

That makes sense, thanks for the pointers.

It is unfortunate that we don't have the required information about the
supported tablets. Excluding the unsupported tablets (when fixing them
is not possible for reasons) seems like a reasonable approach.

I don't know about any broken device handled by the driver, so there is
no need to add new code yet :)
I'll try to keep an eye on DIGImend's issue tracker now that the code
present in the upstream kernel is being released by many distros.

Cheers,
Jose
