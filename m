Can't you just unregister the power-supply device if there hasn't
been any heartbeat for some minutes and go back to the init state
(i.e. the one where you are waiting for a heartbeat to appear for
the first time)?

I think the problem you have is quite specific to the Wacom
hardware. Usually wireless devices are either connected or
disconnected and drivers unregister the battery device on
disconnect. So I think this logic belongs into Wacom specific
code and not in generic power-supply core code.
