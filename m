Hmm; how would we guarantee there was no regressions for other systems 
with such a heuristics change?

IE what if there is a system that doesn't use soc-button-array and has a 
non-zero debounce value in the GpioInt from _AEI() and is wake capable? 
"Today" that would be programmed to the GPIO register.

If we're aiming for a driver specific heuristic another alternative is 
to clear debounce for everything at suspend and restore it at resume.

I actually did that and it seems to work fine on this affected system, 
so I'll draft it up as an alternative to patch v3 3/4.
