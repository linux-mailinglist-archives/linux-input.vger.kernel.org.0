Fn+N -> KEY_VENDOR mapping sounds good to me.

So here is the problem. Keycodes in linux input are not mere
placeholders for something that will be decided later how it is to be
used, they are supposed to communicate intent and userspace ideally does
not need to have any additional knowledge about where the event is
coming from. A keyboard either internal or external sends KEY_SCREENLOCK
and the system should lock the screen. It should not be aware that one
device was a generic USB external keyboard while another had an internal
sensor that recognized hovering palm making swiping motion to the right
because a vendor decided to make it. Otherwise you have millions of
input devices all generating unique codes and you need userspace to
decide how to interpret data coming from each device individually.

If you truly do not have a defined use case for it you have a couple
options:

- assign it KEY_RESERVED, ensure your driver allows remapping to an
  arbitrary keycode, let user or distro assign desired keycode to it

- assign KEY_PROG1 .. KEY_PROG4 - pretty much the same - leave it in the
  hand of the user to define a shortcut in their DE to make it useful

What would it do exactly? Once we have this answer we can define key or
button code (although I do agree that game controller buttons are
different from "normal" keys because they map to the geometry of the
controller which in turn defines their commonly understood function).

But in any case you would not reuse the same keycode for something that
is supposed to invoke a configuration utility and also to let's say
drop a flash grenade in a game.

Thanks.
