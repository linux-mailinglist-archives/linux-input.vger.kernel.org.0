Auxdisplay are not exposed as DRM KMS device, or are they?
I don't see cfag12864b.c using any DRM calls.

DRM drivers are under drivers/gpu/drm.

I know nothing about auxdisplay. If it's fbdev UAPI, then I don't know -
people have been trying to kill it for years, and basing anything on it
seems like a dead idea. Or maybe it's ok for extremely small displays
where there is no display controller to speak of, and definitely no use
ever for dmabuf? Where CPU banging bits of raw pixels is enough, and no
desktop would ever want to touch them.

But I'm not talking about fbdev either, I'm talking about DRM KMS.

Yes, but I do not agree on the similarity at all, nor that it would be
"close to orthogonal" by simply looking at my keyboard. Hans de Goede
iterated on this much better than I.

That's no justification to add even more problems.

Right. I very much believe that is not going to fly in DRM KMS.

Yes, a size limit would make sense in desktop usage.

..Where the great majority of that UAPI is ill-fitting for the device,
and requires userspace to use existing UAPI in completely new ways. KMS
UAPI is also very complex to use, because the devices it is meant for
are complex, timing sensitive, and capable of image processing.

Unfortunately I cannot say anything about any other UAPI options. I know
nothing of any of them. My comments come from being a Weston developer,
a Wayland compositor for both desktop'ish and embedded use cases that
uses DRM KMS.
