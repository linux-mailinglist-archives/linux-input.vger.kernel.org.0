The tablet arrived today and it is a bank holiday in Spain, so I had
some time to bisect the bug.

The first bad commit is 87562fcd1342 ("HID: input: remove the need for
HID_QUIRK_INVERT"):
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220203143226.4023622-11-benjamin.tissoires@redhat.com/
(CCing the folks whose email is in the patch tags)

I reverted the patch on hid/for-next and, after fixing a tiny conflict,
I can confirm that the tablet works again as expected.

I'd need to investigate a bit more over the weekend, but I think that
all HUION tablets with the latest firmware (internally, v2) are
affected.

Those tablets do not set the inrange bit (UCLOGIC_PARAMS_PEN_INRANGE_NONE).
The driver sets it and uses a timer to remove it.
See drivers/hid/hid-uclogic-core.c, function uclogic_raw_event_pen().

However, at least the Huion Inspiroy H640, sends a 0x00 byte when the
tool is removed, making it possible to fix it in the driver [1].

Unfortunately, the affected code path is used by many tablets and I
can not test them, so I'd prefer to hear Benjamin's opinion and see if
this should be fixed in hid-input rather than in the driver before
sending a fix.

Best wishes,
José Expósito
