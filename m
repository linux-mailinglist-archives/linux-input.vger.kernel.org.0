Thank you very much for the detailed explanation.

I see. In HID spec we have consumer code 0x1A3 AL Next Task/Application
that seems to be fitting the bill. And we map it to KEY_NEXT (to which
you voicing the concerns below). But HID also defines

0xb5 Scan Next Track - Moves to the next chapter or track boundary
0xb6 Scan Previous Track - Moves to the previous chapter or track
boundary

that we map to KEY_NEXTSONG and KEY_PREVIOUSSONG and I recommend your
media application(s) to use those for media controls.

OK, I see. Could we call them KEY_NEXT_ELEMENT/KEY_PREV_ELEMENT maybe?
And I would like to see comments describing intended use.

OK, so we have the following keycodes:

KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE
KEY_VIDEO_NEXT
KEY_VIDEO_PREV

They are intended to request to switch between physical displays (see
drivers/acpi/acpi_video.c) and were introduced specifically for that in 
a7ecd1ea913346a72f41a002c365882dc05c9bd5.

The comments on KEY_VIDEO_NEXT and KEY_VIDEO_PREV are unfortunate, I'll
need to fix that, and their use in hid-input.c,
rc-terratec-cinergy-c-pci, and rc-tivo are not correct. I think,
however, that there are not a lot of systems where we have combination
of multiple signal sources, and multiple output displays, so probably
this clash does not matter in practice.

OK, then we shall have it.

Thanks.
