Sorry I am well behind on my patch processing.

The patch is simple enough and if you reviewed the rest, that is fine by me.

Just for the archives:
For the HID part
Acked-by: Benjamin Tissoires <benjamin.tisssoires@redhat.com>

(no need to force push your branch unless you think it's really 
important to have my ack).

Cheers,
Benjamin
