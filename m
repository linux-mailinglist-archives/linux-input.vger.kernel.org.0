I don't think it makes sense to ignore untested devices, unless you
know for a fact they won't work.

But if the name is part of detecting the device, it would certainly
make sense to use that as part of the identifier for the device, rather
than just the USB VIP:PID.

You should be able to add the product strings in the .driver_data, and
check them in probe().
