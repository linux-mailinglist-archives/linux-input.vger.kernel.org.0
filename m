In your case it's a dup. So in _your_ case it will be handled in the
future. For the rest we already have an fwnode member.

Sure.

There are two different comments, one about handler, another about how
to properly write IRQ chip data structure and mask()/unmask()
callbacks.

On some setups this can lead to panic. Why? Is this so critical error?
hardware can't anymore function?

Any reason why irq_valid_mask can't be used for that?

I see, thanks for elaboration.

Maybe you can double check?
