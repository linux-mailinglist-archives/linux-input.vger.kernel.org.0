Yeah the SetBrightness in systemd / logind should work out of box.

Though I just noticed something: For this to be useful, the default
multi_intensity for each component of the multicolor LED in the kernel should be set to
max_brightness, effectively producing white (on RGB LEDs at least).
If it is zero, like now, SetBrightness would IMHO not actually switch
the LED on because of how the calculation of color components works. 
That way systemd wouldn't need to care about whether the LED is
multicolor or not.

The save/restore stuff IMHO works only for backlights and kbd_backlight LEDs,
as seen from the udev rules. At least out of the box. It even seems to stop
working once you would have two kbd_backlights for the same device
(as the name would be kbd_backlight-1, kbd_backlight-2, ... as per the
documentation on LED classdevs.)

Now there are three solutions:

1) Naming the Logitech LEDs <device>:rgb:kbd_backlight-N even on mice
and at some point send a patch to systemd adapting the udev rules to
care for devices with nuemrical suffixes.

2) Naming the LEDs <device>:rgb:backlight-N and send a patch to systemd
adding a new udev rule to cater for backlight LEDs in general.

3) Like 2 but expect users to write their own udev rules if they want
save/restore for Logitech devices.

What's your opinion on the naming? IMHO mice are not exactly keyboards,
so it probably should be a "general" backlight.
(Instead of "indicator", as in version 1 of the patch)

Cheers
