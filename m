Right, I switched to the devm_ version, so I believe it is no longer
needed. I'll remove it.

Thanks! As I'm new to kernel development it is sometimes hard to know the
proper API. While there is some API documentation for the most part I have
not found any good tutorials or overviews. Basically you have to know what
you are looking for already in order to find it.

Thus I have taken to looking at existing drivers and copying the patterns
from those. However it is very hard to know what drivers use the currently
preferred patterns, and which ones use legacy patterns. Better documentation
would be great.

Good catch! Thanks. I wonder why I didn't get any -Wformat warnings about
this?

Good catch! I thought about onstack buffer but couldn't get it working.
However I believe I was confused by the API at the point, and didn't
realise that "acpi_buffer" is not in fact the same as a buffer object in
ACPI. So it might be worth trying again.

This goes back to the whole "I know what I want to do, but I don't know
what the API is named, lets see what others are doing." thing I mentioned
above.

As you said, this is probably fine, as I doubt anyone has used this ACPI
standard on anything except x86, where unaligned reads are fine. Even the
whole endianness conversion will *probably* never come up in practise for
this driver.

Again, we are back to copying patterns from other drivers. Would be great
if there was a way to know which drivers were following current guidelines.
Maybe each subsystem could have a "model" driver, that they could point to
for current best practices?

However, I realised there is in fact no need to store a copy at all. We can
just define

#define quickstart_name(dev) acpi_device_bid(dev->acpi_dev)

and use that. As acpi_device_bid is itself just a macro that returns a
member.

Again no. In this case it didn't come from copying something, but from
the old quickstart driver code from 2010.

I'm switching to this devm_ stuff, seems awesome.

I have fixed these locally, and will submit a new patch at the beginning of
next week. I was hoping to get some feedback on the open questions in the
cover letter before that, but right now that doesn't seem likely to happen.

Best regards,
