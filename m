Relevant part of the report descriptor is here:

     Field(8)
       Physical(Digitizers.Stylus)
       Logical(Digitizers.Preferred Line Style)
       Application(Digitizers.Pen)
       Usage(6)
         Digitizers.Ink
         Digitizers.Pencil
         Digitizers.Highlighter
         Digitizers.Chisel Marker
         Digitizers.Brush
         Digitizers.No Preference
       Logical Minimum(1)
       Logical Maximum(6)
       Physical Minimum(0)
       Physical Maximum(255)
       Unit Exponent(-1)
       Unit(SI Linear : Centimeter)
       Report Size(8)
       Report Count(1)
       Report Offset(88)
       Flags( Variable Absolute NoPreferredState )

To me, it looks almost like it is a bug in the report descriptor itself; 
as you see there are 6 usage values but the report size / count is 1 
byte. The fact that there are 6 usage values in the field confuses 
hid-core. Basically the usage values are used as encoded content for the 
field.

Alternatively I think this could be patched up in the BPF program, as I 
am modifying the content of the raw hid report already; I could just as 
well modify this one also. Or, maybe I could fix the report descriptor 
itself to act as a sane variable, as I am parsing the report descriptor 
already?

Yes, plain hidraw can be sort of used to program the values, however the 
interface is kind of annoying to use for the USI pens. You need to be 
touching the display with the pen before anything is accepted. Maybe 
writing some support code to the libevdev would help.

The hidraw hook is needed for processing the cached values also, USI 
pens report their parameters with a delay of some few hundred ms 
depending on controller vendor. And in some cases they don't report 
anything back before forcibly querying the value from the controller, 
and also the write mechanism acts differently; some controllers report 
the programmed value back, others keep reporting the old value until the 
pen leaves the screen and touches it again.

Right, I think I have plenty of lockdep / scheduler checks enabled in my 
kernel. They generate plenty of spam with i2c-hid without that patch. 
The same issue may not be visible with some other low level hid devices 
though, I don't have testing capability for anything but the i2c-hid 
right now. I2C is quite notorious for the locking aspects as it is slow 
and is used to control some pretty low level stuff like power management 
etc.

Ok I can check this out if it works me also. The samples lead me to 
/dev/hidraw usage.

The new driver was 777 lines diff, the BPF one is 496 lines so it 
appears smaller. The driver did support two different vendors though 
(ELAN+Goodix, with their specific quirks in place), the BPF only a 
single one right now (ELAN).

The vendor specific quirks are a question, do we want to support that 
somehow in a single BPF binary, or should we attach vendor specific BPF 
programs?

Chromium-os devices are one of the main customers for USI pens right 
now, and I am not sure how well they will take the BPF concept. :) I did 
ask their feedback though, and I'll come back on this once I have something.

Personally, I don't have much preference either way at this moment, both 
seem like feasible options. I might lean a bit towards evdev/ioctl as it 
seems a cleaner implementation as of now. The write mechanism I 
implemented for the USI-BPF is a bit hacky, as it just directly writes 
to a shared memory buffer and the buffer gets parsed by the kernel part 
when it processes hidraw event. Anyways, do you have any feedback on 
that part? BPF is completely new to me again so would love to get some 
feedback.

One option is of course to push the write portion of the code to 
userspace and just use hidraw, but we still need to filter out the bogus 
events somehow, and do that in vendor specific manner. I don't think 
this can be done on userspace, as plenty of information that would be 
needed to do this properly has been lost at the input-event level.
