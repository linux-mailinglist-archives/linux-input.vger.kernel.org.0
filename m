A driver can say they support autosuspend today, but I think you are
concerned about the devices that are controlled by class-compliant
drivers, right?  And for those, no, we can't do this in the kernel as
there are just too many broken devices out there.

As proof of this, look at other operating systems.  They had to
implement the same type of "allowed devices" list that we do.  In fact,
we did this for Linux because they did this, which means that when
hardware manufacturers test their device, they only test with other
operating systems and not Linux and so, we need to match what those
other OSes do as well.

Sorry,
