Yes, the current case is exactly the situation described in the link,=20
and the specific implementation process is as described in my previous=20
email. After adding the patch for retest, the exception can be=20
effectively solved. And at present, can the patch be incorporated?

Thank you Thomas for your kind advice!

My previous focus has been locked until mask_irq()/unmask_irq() is not=20
called in pairs, in fact, it can turn on the corresponding irq masked in=20
enable_irq. Looking at the irq_enable() callback implementation of other=20
GPIO interrupt controllers, there are indeed operations on masked registe=
rs.

Thank you all!
