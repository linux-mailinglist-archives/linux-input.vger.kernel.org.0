It's basically humanly impossible to register a pen's button press without 
first producing some movement reports. You have to hold the pen within range 
for it to register, and it's hard to hold it still enough within range to not 
produce movement reports, while also trying to press a button. I think we're 
safe here.

If there are any buttons on the frame, then it's likely possible to 
distinguish their reports from the pen ones by looking at the report contents 
before discarding.
