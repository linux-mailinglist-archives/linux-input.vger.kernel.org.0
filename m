Ack.

Yes that is what my proposal entails.

> In that case what happens if the hardware debounce was ALSO set from the ASL?  You end up with double debouncing I would expect.

A hardware debounce of say 25 ms would still report the button down
immediately, it just won't report any state changes for 25 ms
after that, at least that is how I would expect this to work.

So the 50 ms ignore-button-releases for the sw debounce will start
at the same time as the hw ignore-button-release window and basically
the longest window will win. So having both active should not really
cause any problems.

Still only using one or the other as you propose below would
be better.

Any special handling here should be done in soc_button_array since
this is specific to how with ACPI we have the GPIO resource
descriptors setting up the hw-debounce and then the need to do
software debounce when that was not setup.

As for checking for -ENOTSUPP I would make soc_button_array
do something like this.

ret = debounce_get()
if (ret <= 0)
	use-sw-debounce;

If hw-debounce is supported but not setup, either because
the exact debounce value being requested is not supported
or because the DSDT specified 0, then sw-debouncing should
also be used.

Note this will still require the use of a new no_hw_debounce
flag so that we don't end up enabling hw-debounce in
the hw-debounce is supported but not setup case.

Regards,

Hans
