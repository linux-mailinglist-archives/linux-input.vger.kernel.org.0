Weird that you had to manually retrieve it. It works here, but maybe
because I am logged in on gitlab.fd.o.

Also, just FYI, you shouldn't have to reboot. Just unplug/replug and
you are good. In the same way, if you uninstall the package, you can
just unplug/replug to not have the programs loaded.

As I mentioned in another reply, the more I think of it, the more I
think I should get rid of the "eraser mode". In that Artist Pro 24 I
can detect it through the same mechanics as the HID_QUIRK_NOINVERT
from Illia's patch. But instead of trying to force the device into the
eraser mode, we should just say "this is actually BUTTON_STYLUS_2".

So I'm going to amend the bpf program to do this and hopefully you
won't need the hwdb/udev rule at all.

I'm surprised you need to teach the wacom driver that BTN_STYLUS_2 is
the right click.

flip the stylus on eraser hovering the canvas, Krita shows the Eraser icon =

he event were mixed.

I'll investigate. Maybe I messed up with my event flow patch.

But just to be sure, you don't have a custom configuration in place
for that tablet device?

Cheers,
Benjamin
