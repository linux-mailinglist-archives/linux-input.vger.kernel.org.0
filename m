Right, I realised that after hitting send.

For the record, people have successfully been using the touchpad after
forcing the driver to reprobe through sysfs:

	echo 4-0010 >/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/i2c_hid_of/bind

Thanks for confirming.

Yes, the driver honours this delay regardless of whether a reset gpio is
defined currently, so this is expected.

Right, but since the suppliers are left enabled by the bootloader (and
never disabled by the kernel), that only begs the question of why this
makes a difference.

Without the delay, the other HID devices are probing (successfully)
slightly before, but essentially in parallel with the touchscreen while
using the same resources. Is that causing trouble somehow?

Or is there a bug in the i2c controller driver affecting only this
device that can be worked around by adding a delay before the first
transfer?
