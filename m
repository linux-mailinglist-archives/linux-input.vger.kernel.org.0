Precisely.  So if the point of the patch is to match users' 
expectations, and some users expect to be able to wake up their systems 
by moving the mouse but their mouse is like yours, then the situation is 
hopeless and the patch won't help.

The usual counterexample is laptop-in-a-knapsack.  You don't want the 
laptop to wake up just because the knapsack was picked up and that 
jostled the mouse.

Overall, it seems like this patch needs a better justification.
