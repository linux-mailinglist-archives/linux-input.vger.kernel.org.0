Fine with me.

It would shorten the code and remove a comment :). Also, a good memmem
implementation should be very fast, potentially faster than your loop.
I suspect the latter is only true in user code where SSE would get
used, but still.

it would also be unfortunate if some firmware update switches to
4-byte alignment and touchscreens stop working with no explanation.
