Thank you for this package.=20

I was able to test it even though the link in (2) at the bottom of your ema=
il returned a blank page. I was able to find my way after manually visiting=
 gitlab.freedesktop.org [1] and then manually downloading the article from =
51350589. I unzipped it and ran `sudo ./install.sh --verbose`. Everything l=
ooks like it was successful [2]. I then rebooted my Fedora 38 'Linux workst=
ation 6.5.8-200.fc38.x86_64' kernel (the one I blamed in my post) and teste=
d both tablets.=20

Here are my observation:

XPPEN Artist Pro 24
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Nothing changed for this device (it's the one with two buttons and no 'eras=
er tip'). Nor my hwdb/udev rules or `xsetwacom set "UGTABLET 24 inch PenDis=
play eraser" button 1 3` affects the upper button of the stylus: if I hold =
it hover the canvas, Krita switch the tool and cursor for an eraser. If I c=
lick on the canvas with the pen tip while holding the upper button pressed,=
 I get the right-click Pop-up Palette (but not all the time, probably Krita=
 has hard time to triage Eraser or Right-click).

XPPEN Artist Pro 16 (Gen2)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D
Something changed. `xsetwacom set "UGTABLET Artist Pro 16 (Gen2) eraser" bu=
tton 1 3` successfully affected the upper button of the stylus. Now if I cl=
ick it while hovering the canvas, Krita shows the right click Pop-up Palett=
e.
On the downside; the real eraser tip when I flip the stylus bugs. When I fl=
ip the stylus on eraser hovering the canvas, Krita shows the Eraser icon an=
d switch tool. As soon as I draw with the eraser tip, Krita will also show =
a right-click color palette and with also not a 100% consistency, as if the=
 event were mixed.
