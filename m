Having multiple devices linked to a single node is quite normal. Most
multifunctional devices will share a single node. The USB port devices
will share their node (if they have one) with any device that is
attached to them. Etc.

If you want to check how this works with ACPI, then find
"physical_node" named files from sysfs. The ACPI node folders in sysfs
have symlinks named "physical_node<n>" for every device they are bind
to. The first one is named just "physical_node", the second
"physical_node1", the third "physical_node2", and so on.

I don't think I completely understand the use case you had in mind for
this API, but since you planned to use it with the GPIO lookup tables,
I'm going to assume it's not needed after all. Let's replace those
with the references instead like I proposed in my reply to the 2/2
patch.

Linking a single device with a node like that is in any case not
acceptable nor possible.
