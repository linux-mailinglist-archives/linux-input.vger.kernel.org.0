All good - I was just worried we'd promised something previously and not delivered. We're often slow at delivering - but I try not to fail completely. I try especially hard not to annoy hard working kernel maintainers :)

We do have something developed internally, but it's pretty basic and we'll need to have discussion with 'userspace' fol as to if we release that as a standalone application, or if we tie into gnome (which we don't have a lot of experience with)...or something else.
Kernel world is much easier :)

This is way off topic for the patch set, but as you asked :)

I'm afraid I'm going to disagree. What you're suggesting is probably the more common and easier route vendors take, but it has some issues and I think some longer term limitations.
For me one of the things I like the most about our program using the same exact HW as Windows is it means:
 - I have a business lever to get Linux support from HW vendors. This makes a difference when you're dealing with 'minor' components - panels, fingerprint readers, touchpads etc - the smaller devices (though it helps for the CPU vendors too). We have requirements that state the upstream Linux support is needed or the chip vendor will not be considered for the platform...and that's a big deal.
 - It gets FW teams thinking about Linux support. Yeah, there are still a ton of issues there and it's far from perfect, but it means they have to think about Linux support and at least helps us shine a bit of light on what is going on in that horrible closed box.
 - It means I get Linux running at a good level on a wider range of HW then would be otherwise possible. It means that when there is new technology I get to go and ask "how about Linux" and have that discussion (including schedules). It might come later than I'd like - but at least we get to put Linux on the roadmap rather than being excluded for being so niche. Shrug.

I think our Linux program still has a long way to go before it's even close to good - but it's in better shape than it (at least I think so, I don't love the way the industry is going with more being stuffed in FW...but that's above my paygrade)

Ack.
So I've been refactoring my patches to implement the feedback from Hans for the latter patches and just need to figure out what works here.

For the SYS_DEBUG_INFO, if you'd rather we use KEY_VENDOR (I think that's my preference - as its intended for a Lenovo support role it seems the best fit), and Peter has no objections, I will make that change.

I have a stronger preference to keep the KEY_DOUBLECLICK - that one seems less controversial as a genuine new input event.

Is that OK?

Mark
