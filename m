Greetings My dear,


   This letter might be a surprise to you, But I believe that you will
be honest to fulfill my final wish. I bring peace and love to you. It
is by the grace of god, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and
right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for
witness of god=E2=80=99s mercy and glory upon my life. My dear, I sent this
mail praying it will find you in a good condition, since I myself am in
a very critical health condition in which I sleep every night without
knowing if I may be alive to seethe next day. I am Mrs.Hannah Vandrad,
a widow suffering from a long time illness. I have some funds I
inherited from my late husband, the sum of($11,000,000.00, Eleven
Million Dollars) my Doctor told me recently that I have serious
sickness which is a cancer problem. What disturbs me most is my
stroke sickness. Having known my condition, I decided to donate this
fund to a good person that will utilize it the way I am going to
instruct herein. I need a very honest and God fearing person who can
claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages and gives
justice and help to the poor, needy and widows says The Lord." Jeremiah
22:15-16.=E2=80=9C and also build schools for less privilege that will be n=
amed
after my late husband if possible and to promote the word of god and
the effort that the house of god is maintained.

 I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an
ungodly manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of
death, so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do
not have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I
want your sincere and urgent answer to know if you will be able to
execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank account. May the grace, peace,
love and the truth in the Word of god be with you and all those that
you love and  care for.

I am waiting for your reply.

May God Bless you,

 Mrs. Hannah Vandrad.
