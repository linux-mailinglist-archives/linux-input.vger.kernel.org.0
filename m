HI Marek & Dmiitry,
	My colleague and me,we have different voice about this, I would
appreciate your comment about this.

Simply:
I think
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
supports  to use string type Kconfig, although this type is not used
much;
we use string type kconfig to select which drivers to build in, every 
built in driver itself detect its hw according to its dts info, and
exit if detect fail; 
ifdef chaos in vendor kernel.. I think there is a touch common driver
layer, and common drv and specific drv is not layered ideal.

Thanks so much for your kindly help and repley.

As time goes by, more and more touch types will be added in our platform. To avoid hard-coding it into the kernel configuration, I use 'string' type Kconfig, and it will aways keeps one config no matter how many touch drivers we want.
For example, we have touch1, touch2...touch10. We need 10 Kconfigs if we use 'bool' type Kconfig.

I have already tested the 'string' type Kconfig, standard build tools supports well. (such as in android P and kernel 4.14).
And the document down below also shows Kbuild have the 'string' type Kconfig https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt

Btw, In my opinion, DT is used for configuring  the touch device info such as i2c slaver address. But we need to decide which touch driver should be build in for a project.
