Thanks for CCing me Jiří.

Thanks a lot for reporting the issue.

HUION and other non-Wacom tablets are handled by the UCLogic driver.
This driver is present in the kernel but its changes were deployed
and tested first in the DIGImend driver:
https://github.com/DIGImend/digimend-kernel-drivers

A while ago, I started including in the kernel the code present in
DIGImend. At this moment, 5.19.0-RC7 and DIGImend have the same code
(well, 5.19 has more features, but they don't affect your tablet).

I'm telling you this because it might be easier for you to bisect the
changes in the DIGImend driver as it builds way faster than the kernel.
Let me know if you need help bisecting it and I'll do my best to help
you.

Is this your device?
https://www.huion.com/pen_tablet/Inspiroy/H640P.html

It is affordable, so I ordered it. I don't have any HUION devices to
debug and this is a good excuse to buy one ;)
I'll let you know how it goes once I receive it.

Jose
