I did dismiss it because I thought that is only relevant for firmware, but I now stumbled upon the Virtual HID Framework (VHF) https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/virtual-hid-framework--vhf- and now I wonder if an equivalent exists for Linux? A quick search did not yield any results for me.

I just read the thread, and I think I now understand a little bit what
this request is :)

IMO working with the HID LampArray is the way forward. So I would
suggest to convert any non-HID RGB "LED display" that we are talking
about as a HID LampArray device through `hid_allocate_device()` in the
kernel. Basically what you are suggesting Hans. It's just that you don't
need a formal transport layer, just a child device that happens to be
HID.

The next question IMO is: do we want the kernel to handle such
machinery? Wouldn't it be simpler to just export the HID device and let
userspace talk to it through hidraw, like what OpenRGB does?

If the kernel already handles the custom protocol into generic HID, the
work for userspace is not too hard because they can deal with a known
protocol and can be cross-platform in their implementation.

I'm mentioning that cross-platform because SDL used to rely on the
input, LEDs, and other Linux peculiarities and eventually fell back on
using hidraw only because it's way more easier that way.

The other advantage of LampArray is that according to Microsoft's
document, new devices are going to support it out of the box, so they'll
be supported out of the box directly.

Most of the time my stance is "do not add new kernel API, you'll regret
it later". So in that case, given that we have a formally approved
standard, I would suggest to use it, and consider it your API.

Side note to self: I really need to resurrect the hidraw revoke series
so we could export those hidraw node to userspace with uaccess through
logind...

Cheers,
Benjamin
