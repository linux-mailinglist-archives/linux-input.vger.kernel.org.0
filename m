Sweet, that means that we are on the right track and the implementation
can be generic... Meaning that we won't need to write and maintain a
bunch of HID descriptors :)

You are right, 60 and not 127 is the right value. Actually, I think
that -61 - 60 is the correct range, because of the 0.
Running "libinput-debug-tablet" makes it easier to debug.

I also had to fix the descriptor to avoid an issue with the pressure
causing issues with the Deco L, but other than that, it should be
correct now.

Code comments and suggestions are very welcome, as well as testing.

Also, I don't know if you have seen this error after connecting the
tablet:

  xhci_hcd 0000:2a:00.3: WARN urb submitted to disabled ep
  usb 3-2: reset full-speed USB device number 6 using xhci_hcd
  usb 3-2: reset full-speed USB device number 6 using xhci_hcd
  [...]

It happens with the Deco Mini 4, even when using the hid-generic
driver. I need to rebase my patches on 5.19 and test again, just to
make sure the problem is not somewhere else.

Jose
