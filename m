I think this one is the TGL PCH xHCI. The quirk currently for xHCI
controllers that are part of the TCSS (Type-C SubSystem) where it is
important to put all devices into low power mode whenever possible,
otherwise it keeps the whole block on.

Typically we haven't done that for PCH side xHCI controllers though, but
I don't see why not if it works that is. Adding Mathias to comment more
on that since he is the xHCI maintainer.
