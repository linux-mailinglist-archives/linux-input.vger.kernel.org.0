This looks like I2C-HID controller and I see bunch of "incomplete
report"s in the logs:

[16558.456434] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-ELAN0670:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (14/3583)
[16558.457434] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-ELAN0670:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (14/259)
[16558.458384] i2c_hid_acpi i2c-ELAN0670:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (14/65281)

Let's add benjamin, Jiri and Jungle...
