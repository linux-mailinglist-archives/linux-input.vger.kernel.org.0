We have kptr feature now.
So bpf progs can store pointers to specific kernel data structures
inside map values.
Storing 'struct bpf_map *' in a map value would be something :)
Circular dependency issues to address. Maybe it's doable.

Would hash based prog_array work ?
Then the key can be an arbitrary combination.
There is fd_htab logic. It's used for map-in-map.
We can tweak it to store progs in a hash map.
