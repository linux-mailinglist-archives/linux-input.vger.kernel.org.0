Hello Pavel,

I'm sorry, I've been sending a lot of things lately and I forgot to add
that list to the Cc on some series...

Btw, we don't have any MediaTek android phone working at all on mainline:
the one that I'm in the process of upstreaming would be the first one ever,
the hope is that doing this will encourage other developers to do the same
with other platforms.

Speaking of them all... I don't think that there's any retail smartphone
that comes with Android having any phone call ability... I'm aware of some
Qualcomm smartphones being able to use mobile data and SMS, but no calling.

Unless anything changed and unless I'm unaware of recent developments.

Aside from that, MediaTek chips should be a little simpler in this regard,
so I think that we can (and I would love to) get that working, so that
smartphones can still be smart -- phones -- on mainline as well... but I
have a hunch that this will require quite some time.

Regards,
Angelo
