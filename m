This is not correct.

Good / no-good is only matter of few dozens of bytes here and there to be saved.

No, it won't make sense, because the structures will be part of
_add_driver_gpio() call, due to which compiler likely can't recognize unused
structures. However, you may try with warnings enabled `make W=1`.

I see. So, this is for Dmitry's preferences.
