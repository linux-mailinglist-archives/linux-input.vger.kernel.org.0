I'm sorry, I don't know the input framework well enough to understand
what you had in mind exactly. Could you send a patch with your
suggestion for the hid-nvidia-shield so we can discuss this further?

That being said, I think that the current design around name, phys and
uniq is fairly treacherous to drivers and we should aim for a solution
that prevents that issue from being possible at all.

I was inclined to go for a char array for each to get rid of the pointer
entirely, but Benjamin raised some concerns over the structure size so
it's probably not a great solution.
