Out of curiosity, are there any machines that actually need this
"panel-follower" API today, or are saying above that this is just
something that may be needed one day?

Sure, but that's a policy decision and not something that should be
hard-coded in our drivers.

Ok, so with the current panel-follower implementation you essentially
only waste a bit of memory in case of a non-populated touchscreen (e.g.
by keeping the platform and follower devices registered).

I never said "a lot", I used the word "unnecessary". But how much it
adds also depends on whether you need additional synchronisation.

But again, the main point is that the "panel-follower" feature should
not complicate and obfuscate the driver's probe implementation. And
looking up resources belongs in probe().

I talked to Benjamin at Kernel Recipes last week and I don't think he
has any fundamental objections to the fix I'm proposing.

I prefer it as it makes the code easier to reason about and clearly
marks the code paths that differ in case the device is a "panel
follower". And since you said it also makes the code look more like what
you originally intended, then I guess you should be ok with it too?

Looking at the patch again, I may do a v2 to only look up the "panel"
property once even if that's a really minor optimisation.

Yeah, that doesn't seem right, though. The interrupt line is not really
shared, it's just that we need to check whether the device is populated
before requesting the interrupt.
