If waking the machine up by mouse/keyboard activity is not desired in
Hyper-V environment, then simply disable them as wakeup sources.

Whatever initiates hibernation (in userspace) can adjust wakeup sources
as needed if you want them disabled completely.

No, I believe this a hack, that is why I am pushing back on this.

How long is the prepare() phase on your systems? User may wiggle mouse
at any time really, even before the notifier fires up.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ If you do not want to implement hibernation properly in vmbus
code that is totally up to you (have you read in pm.h how freeze() is
different from suspend()?).
