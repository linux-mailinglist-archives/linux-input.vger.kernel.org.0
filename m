Yes, this is a fundamental property of C pointers - you should not free
them before exiting last code section that may reference them. For input
devices it means that pointers should not be freed until after
input_unregister_device() is called.

I.e. you have sequence like this:

	driver_data = kzalloc(...);
	driver_data->input_name = kstrdup(...);
	driver_data->input_phys = kstrdup(...);
	input = input_allocate_device();
	input->name = driver_data->input_name;
	input->phys = driver_data->input_phys;
	input_register_device(input);
	...

	input_unregister_device(input);
	kfree(driver_data->input_name);
	kfree(driver_data->input_phys);
	kfree(driver_data);


devm typically helps with resources being freed at the right time, but
for that the managed resources should be attached to the *correct
device*, with correct device being one the driver is binding to, not any
random device structure.

Yes, it looks like the shield is also using wrong device.

Thanks.
