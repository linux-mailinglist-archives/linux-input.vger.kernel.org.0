Oh, interesting.
I have been working this week with that limitation in place, and I
just managed to get something working yesterday night. See below.

That's basically your last suggestion below.

That's an interesting approach. Much less convoluted than the one I
have right now. The only downside I see is that every program will be
called for every event, which might not be ideal (though the event
stream from HID is way smaller than network).

Not a big fan of that...

freplace might not work for me because I want to attach more than one
program to a given HID device. Not so sure BPF_PROG_TYPE_REPLACE will
do something enough there.

This is roughly what I have now:

- hid-core is not aware of BPF except for a few __weak
ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION hooks (dispatch_hid_bpf_device_event for
example)
- I have a separate hid-bpf module that attaches BPF traces to these
hooks and calls a "dispatch" kfunc within hid-bpf
- the dispatch function then do a succession of BPF calls to programs
attached to it by using bpf_tail_call(prog_array, hid_id)

- for the clients, they define one or more
SEC("fmod_ret/hid_bpf_device_event"). That __weak hook is declared in
the kernel by hid-bpf but is never called, it's just an API
declaration
- then clients call in a SEC("syscall")
hid_bpf_attach_prog(ctx->prog_fd, ctx->hid_id, ctx->flags);
- hid_bpf_attach_prog is a kfunc that takes a ref on the struct
bpf_prog*, and stores that program in the correct struct bpf_map *for
the given attached_btf_id (hid_bpf_device_event in our case)

And that's about it.
I still need to handle automatic release of the bpf prog when there is
no userspace open fd on it unless it's pinned but I think this should
be working fine.

I also probably need to pin some SEC("syscall") (hid_bpf_attach_prog
and hid_bpf_dettach_prog) so users don't have to write them down and
can just use the ones provided by the kernel.

The nice thing is that I can define my own API for the attach call
without dealing with bpf core. I can thus add a priority flag that is
relevant here because the data coming through the bpf program can be
modified.

The other thing is that now, I don't care which function we are in to
decide if a RET_PTR_MEM is read only or not. I can deal with that by
either playing with the flags or even replacing entirely the dispatch
trace prog from userspace if I want to access the raw events.

However, the downsides are:
- I need to also define kfuncs for BPF_PROG_TYPE_SYSCALL (I don't
think It'll be a big issue)
- The only way I could store the bpf_prog into the map was to hack
around the map ops, because the fd of the map in the skel is not
available while doing a SEC("syscall") from a different process.

Also, I wonder if we should not have some way to namespace kfuncs.
Ideally, I would like to prevent the usage of those kfuncs outside of
some helpers that I define in HID so I don't have to worry too much
about other trace programs fuzzing and segfaulting the kernel.

With the above, I actually don't need those notifications. Users are
calling my own "syscall" when attaching their BPF prog, and they are
also not required to attach the program to the actual BPF trace
(through BPF_PROG_ATTACH), so this request is now gone :)
