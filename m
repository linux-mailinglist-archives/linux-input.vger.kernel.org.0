Dear friend how are you today?
I know you will be surprise to receive this message from me because; we have n
ot met before but please listen to me very well. I am writing you this mail fr
om a Hospital. My name is Mrs. Anna Mustafa. I am a widow and very sick now. I
 am suffering from Endometrial Cancer which my doctor has confirmed that I wil
l not survive it because of some damages. Now because of the condition of my h
ealth I have decided to donate out my late husband fund the sum  of $3, 500,00
0.00 on Charity Purpose through your  help. All you have to do is to use the m
oney in the following ways.

(1) To build school for the poor children.
(2) To help the Orphanages, Sick People, and Poor Widows etc. If you agree to 
help me, I will instruct the bank to proceed and transfer the money to your ac
count to enable you start this project on my behalf since I am very sick now a
nd cannot do this work by myself.

Lastly, after the transfer of the money to your account, I permit you to take 
out 30% of the money for your recompense in doing this work. I don’t have a c
hild or any available relative who can inherit this money when I die. I wil te
ll you more about myself and how to proceed forward on this transaction.God bl
ess you.
Mrs. Anna
