I am sorry to hear that. I am not involved in Gnome so I am not sure why
it takes so long, I guess not tablets or detachables are a minority of
deployments so it is not prioritized? Android seems to have a handle on
this as does Chrome OS...

I guess you will next want to patch cros_ec_keyb in case someone uses
generic distro with x86 Chromebooks, and then matrix keypad, and then
all drivers that are used outside of x86.

Rafael has made assertion that in S3 it is impossible to differentiate
whether the button is power button or not. But looking at this I do not
think it is correct assertion. "Notify Wake" is sent for a given
button. Or maybe I misunderstood and he meant that the *state* if button
is not available in "Notify Wake"?

In fact, I think login in the ACPI button is pretty broken and needs to
be undone/reverted:

1. The driver sends KEY_WAKEUP events on every resume. It does not
matter if wakeup is done by pressing power button, wake or lan packet,
or an act of God, it will send KEY_WAKEUP as part of the button *device*
resume.

2. There is a patch from Mario (a8605b0ed187) suppressing sending
KEY_POWER as part of "normal" wakeup handling, pretty much the same as
what he and you are proposing to do in gpio-keys (and eventually in
every driver keyboard or button driver in the kernel). This means we no
longer can tell if wakeup is done by power button or sleep button (on
systems with dual-button models, see ACPI 4.8.3.1).

To me it seems we are piling workarounds on top of workarounds. We
should report either KEY_POWER or KEY_SLEEP in the notify event for both
"Notify Wake" and "Notify State", and let userspace make decision on how
to handle this best.

I do not understand why you call KEY_WAKEUP being "proper". Especially
with gpio-keys you do not know if wakeup is really due to this
particular button being pressed, or the system woke up for some other
reason and user also happened to have the button pressed. ACPI button is
really an outlier here because firmware interface defines a dedicated
event for waking up.

This assumes the driver does not report state between press and release,
which is not guaranteed. Or we now require drivers to keep track whether
release for KEY_WAKEUP has been done and that it can return to reporting
KEY_POWER.

Does it really? Aside of ACPI button you have no idea if button press
coincided with some other event waking up the system. You can guess, but
that is it, a guess.

No, you are making assumptions, but instead of doing it in userspace
where you can give user choice to adjust the behavior you are
hard-coding it.

Please fix Gnome. It is possible to handle rapid power button presses
(because other OSed/environments do that).

not know if button press was the real cause of wakeup or it simply
coincided with something else).
