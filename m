Makes sense, will do. However, there is nothing x86 specific in theory with
this driver. Would it not make more sense to put it under drivers/acpi?

I had a look at this, and it seems like a much more complicated a approach,
for example, there is no dedicated .ops.notify, which means I need to use
acpi_install_notify_handler, and there is no devm_ version of that either.
A lot of other things seem to be ever so slightly more complicated as well. 

What is the motivation behind this being preferred? And are most of the
existing drivers using acpi_driver legacy (e.g. toshiba_acpi)?
