My Dearest One,

CHARITY DONATION Please read carefully, I know it is true that this
letter may come to you as a surprise. I came across your e-mail
contact through a private search while in need of your assistance. I
am writing this mail to you with heavy sorrow in my heart, I have
chose to reach out to you through Internet because it still remains
the fastest medium of communication.

My Name is Mrs. marilyn   John  Carlsen I am native Denmark, wife of
late Mr John Carlsen currently hospitalized in a private hospital here
in Ouagadougou Burkina Faso as a result of lungs cancer I am 62 years
old and I was diagnosed of lungs cancer for about 4 years ago,
immediately after the death of my husband, who has left me everything
he worked for. I'm with my laptop in a hospital here in where I have
been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs. I have some funds
inherited from my late husband, the sum of Eleven Million  United
States Dollars Only (USD $11.000.000).Now it's clear that I=E2=80=99m
approaching the last-days of my life and I don't think I need this
money anymore. My doctor made me to understand that I would not last
for the period of one year due to Lungs cancer problem.

This money is still with the Bank and the management wrote me as the
true owner to come forward to receive the money or rather issue a
letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I
can't come over because of my illness. Failure to act the bank may get
fund confiscated for keeping it so long.

I decided to contact you if you maybe willing and interested to help
me withdraw this money from the Bank then use the funds for Charity
works in helping the less privileged and also to fight against
Covid-19 Pandemic in the society. I want you to handle these trust
funds in good faith before anything happens to me. This is not a
stolen money and there are no dangers involved is 100% risk free with
full legal proof.

I want you to take 45% of the total money for your personal used while
55% of the money will go to charity work. I will appreciate your
utmost trust and confidentiality in this matter to accomplish my heart
desire, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish. I
am very sorry if you received this letter in your spam, is due to
recent connection error here in the country.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
Bank. I will also issue you a letter of authorization which will prove
that you are the new beneficiary of my funds and the documents
concerning the deposit. Please assure me that you will act accordingly
as I stated herein. Hope to hear from you soonest. I am waiting for
your response urgently.

Yours Beloved Sister.
Mrs. marilyn  John Carlsen.
