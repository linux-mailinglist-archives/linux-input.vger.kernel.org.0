Sorry you had to dig into the individual patch changelogs for that
I sorta assumed that everyone involved would still vaguely remember
what this series is about.

There is 1 pseudo driver drivers/platform/touchscreen_dmi.c which provides
info which under Windows is hardcoded in device-model specific drivers to
the touchscreen drivers as device-properties.

This pseudo driver is modified to provide the info which
drivers/firmware/efi/embedded-firmware.c needs to find the firmware,
so that we keep the per-model info in 1 file.

Then 2 normal touchscreen drivers are modified to opt-in into the
new EFI-firmware loading mechanism.

This whole thing is a clever hack to get around us being unable to get
redistribution permission for (touchscreen) firmwares where the chip vendor
says the firmware is model specific so part of the copyright lays with the
odm/oem and we should talk to them (the odm) and the odm/oem points back
to the chip vendor...

Windows does not get the firmware from the UEFI copy, the windows driver
is model specific. The windows driver is part of the os-image the device ships
with and you are in trouble if you loose the driver. This windows driver
has its own embedded copy of the model specific touchscreen firmware
(oh if only they had put said firmware in some nvram on the chip).

In some cases, mostly on Intel Cherry Trail based tablets, which are
cheap and thus use the cheapest touchscreens which have this problem,
the UEFI contains a "mouse" driver which has a copy, which is what this
patch set adds support for to get around the not being able to distribute
problem.

As such this is not really common, still there are a lot of those cheap
Cherry Trail tablets and new ones are still being manufactured. One of the
reasons I'm spending time on making these work 100% OOTB is to get around
the standard Linux sucks at tablets because desktop devs have no tablet
hw to develop a tablet ui on issue.

I also have tried to make the mechanism generic since I guess it might
become in handy for some other scenarios in the future.

Putting a number on this is hard. I do know several members of my
local hackerspace have such tablets since they are cheap and it is nice
to play around with Linux on them. I would guess a number would be between
1% and 0.1%, but I may be way off.

I would assume that if we can get distribution permission we will also
be able to update the linux-firmware version later. So atm I'm not worried
about this scenario.

The way this works is that drivers/firmware/efi/embedded-firmware.c
only checks for firmwares listed in its embedded_fw_table[]. Entries in
this table need to be manually added. We basically do a brute-force
search of the EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_CODE segments looking for a magic prefix
and then checking for a known SHA256 sum. This is triggered by a DMI
match to avoid slowing the boot with the search on other devices
(UEFI has no standard way to get embedded firmware copies out of it).

I would assume someone going through the trouble to add an entry
to embedded_fw_table[] to also check that things work without a copy
in /lib/firmware.

So the scenario of a new entry showing up, without the matching driver
getting modified is somewhat unlikely. At the same time the firmware-loader
people want to avoid changing the fw-load code paths for all drivers, for
something which so far is used by only very few drivers.

It is a hidden option and drivers which need this already select it in
this patch-set.

You are right that we are exposed to the EFI firmware anyway on top we
only load embedded firmwares with a known SHA256 and so far the firmware
only gets used for touchscreen controllers which cannot do DMA.

So all in all I am not concerned about security. An attacker would need
to be able to write EFI_BOOT_SERVICES_CODE segments, yet not be able to
find a better attack vector then this; and he would need to be able to
fake an expected SHA256 sum on a Trojan firmware payload, which all
is quite unlikely.
