Hopefully you'll be able to figure out a way to have your emails
posted to the lkml soon. It's very valuable to have them in
lore.kernel.org to get the thread context.

Yes, you are correct. The device talks a given protocol (HID) and is
supposed to use the specification from Microsoft[0] on how to behave
properly. As such, it has to convey the "eraser" state by adding
dedicated information in the event stream.

In your case, I think we (the kernel and your stylus) simply talk past
each other and we lose information.

em at the design stage and I have probably a way of passing on the informat=

If the pen has 2 buttons, and an eraser side, it would be a serious
design flow for XPPEN to report both as eraser.

Could you please use sudo hid-recorder from hid-tools[1] on any kernel
version and send us the logs here?
I'll be able to replay the events locally, and understand why the
kernel doesn't work properly.

And if there is a design flaw that can be fixed, we might even be able
to use hid-bpf to change it :)

Generally speaking, relying on X to fix your hardware is going to be a
dead end. When you switch to wayland, you'll lose all of your fixes,
which isn't great.

I still stand by the points that I made in my blog post:
>
> - I don't have any way to customise the hardcoded eraser buttons in users=
pace and **it is a problem**: for devices without a touchscreen or mouse, n=

batable here.

AFAIU, the kernel now "merges" both buttons, which is a problem. It
seems to be a serious regression. This case is also worrying because I
added regression tests on hid, but I don't have access to all of the
various tablets, so I implemented them from the Microsoft
specification[0]. We need a special case for you here.

> - In the case of a pen that already has an eraser tip on the other side o=
f the device [2], it makes no sense to exchange the right-click top button =
for another way to erase. Also in userspace, there seems to be no way to di=
stinguish between the two buttons (the eraser tip and the eraser button). A=
ll actions from xsetwacom, xinput/libinput target the two eraser devices, a=
nd they target them unsuccessfully too.

Again, we can't do more than what the device reports. Well, we can
always quirk it in some cases, but ideally we don't have to do
anything. MS spec [0], only shows a single button pen with an eraser
tail or a pen with 2 buttons, one of them being the eraser one. I'm
not sure if they decided to prevent dual button pens with eraser tail,
but Wacom definitely has some, and they work.

Without the actual data from your pen, I can not tell much, because I
don't follow which path we are taking on the kernel side. Please
report with your hid-recorder logs, so I can understand why this is
happening and how we can fix it.

AFAICT 276e14e6c3 already had the hid tests integrated at
tools/testing/selftests/hid/tests/test_tablet.py

It would have been great to add the cases you are mentioning here,
because there is a strong chance I'll break things once again when we
try to fix that regression.
