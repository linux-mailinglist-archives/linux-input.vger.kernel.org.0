Hi Dmitry,

Thank you for the clarification.

In that case, would you consider accepting a patch adding a sentence
or two explaining that handlers will need to keep track of effect IDs
in this manner? Either in uinput documentation or just in the comment
describing how to implement upload_effect() in uinput.h. Something
along the lines of "Effects received here will never have an ID of -1.
Handlers of these effects must recognize previously unseen effect IDs
to know when a new effect has been allocated.".

Cheers,
John
