No, that's the whole point: the hardware is designed so that the reset
line can be left deasserted by the CPU also when the supply is off.

The supply in this case is shared with the keyboard and touchpad, but
also some other devices which are not yet fully described. As you
rightly noted, the intention is to allow the supply to eventually be
disabled when none of these devices are enabled as wakeup sources.

I did not want to get in to too much details on exactly how this
particular reset circuit is designed, but basically you have a pull up
to an always-on 1.8 V rail on the CPU side, a FET level shifter, and a
pull up to the supply voltage on the peripheral side.

With this design, the reset line can be left deasserted by the CPU
(tri-stated or driven high), but the important part is that the reset
signal that goes into the controller will be pulled to 3.3 V only when
the supply is left on and otherwise it will be connected to ground.

If you look at the DT patch that's essentially what I'm doing by
describing the reset pin as open-drain so that it will be configured as
an input (tristated) when reset is deasserted and only driven low when
reset is asserted.

The second-source problem is arguable a separate one, and as we've
discussed in the past, the current approach of describing both devices
in the devicetree only works when the devices are truly compatible in
terms of external resources (supplies, gpios, pinconfig). For anything
more complex, we need a more elaborate implementation.

In this case it should not be a problem, though, as the reset circuit
should have the same properties regardless of which controller you
connect (e.g. both nodes would have the 'no-reset-on-power-off'
property).
