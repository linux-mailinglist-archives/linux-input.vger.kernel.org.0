Following a suggestion by Hans de Goede, I reworked the quirk tables in the
i8042 driver. Now all quirks only use a single table. This makes quirks
easier to search by device and reduces code line count and memory usage.

The frist patch is minor housekeeping new to this 4th revision

The 2nd patch merges the tables together.

The 3rd patch add optional debug output to see which quirks get applied.

The 4th patch adds a list of Clevo devices that need multiple quirks.
With the reworked table they don't need to be inserted multiple times now,
which was required in v1 and v2 of this patch.

I also included the extra quirk for the Clevo NS7xMU, which was a separate
patch before.

The added Clevo devices are now only identified by their board name as this
is the only somewhat reliable string that might not be changed by resellers.
