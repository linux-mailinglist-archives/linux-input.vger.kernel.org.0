Ok, I prefer not hiding away things like that as it obscures what's
really going on, for example, in this case, that you register a device
without really having probed it.

As I alluded to in the commit message, you probably want to be able to
support second-source touchscreen panel followers as well at some point
and then deferring checking whether device is populated until the panel
is powered on is not going to work.

I skimmed the thread were you added this, but I'm not sure I saw any
reason for why powering on the panel follower temporarily during probe
would not work?

That was my first idea as well, but conceptually it is more correct to
request resources at probe time and not at some later point when you can
no longer fail probe.

You'd also need to handle the fact that the interrupt may never have
been requested when remove() is called, which adds unnecessary
complexity.
