    47		This module supports these devices separately using a separate
    48		event interface on /dev/hidraw.
    49	
    50		There is also a /dev/hiddev configuration option in the USB HID
    51		configuration menu. In comparison to hiddev, this device does not process
    52		the hid events at all (no parsing, no lookups). This lets applications
    53		to work on raw hid events when they want to, and avoid using transport-specific
