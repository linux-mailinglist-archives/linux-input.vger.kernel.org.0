That sounds to me like something you would test once for a given
platform and then the values are static. If you are actually changing it
at *runtime*, how is doing it through DT suitable? Does your firmware do
the tests & then set the values in DT dynamically?

How do you detect the IC's abilities?

Okay.

That seems like a bad idea, we want to be able to build one kernel that
works for all hardware at the same time.

Also, pleae don't top post, but instead reply in-line with my comments,
as I have done here.

No idea. Maybe try to split it into multiple patches?
The other option is to also cc patches@lists.linux.dev as that has some
higher capacities, but that's not going to be a silver bullet.

Thanks,
