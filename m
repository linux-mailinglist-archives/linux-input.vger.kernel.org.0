Great, many thx. Saw it right after sending my mail... :-/

Yes, that is an idea in the long run, but I'm not sure if it's wise now
or later. People easily get annoyed by these mails (which I totally
understand!) and then will start hating the bot or regression tracking
in general. That's why I'm really careful here.

There are also the subsystems that regularly flush their fixes shortly
before a new -rc, so they likely never want to see such reminders. And
sending them right after a new -rc is better than nothing, but not ideal
either.

IOW: it's complicated. :-/

Understood and no worries. But this became a good opportunity to raise
the general problem, as that is something that bugs me. Sorry. Hope you
don't mind to much that I used that chance.

> So a friendly reminder could make things go faster.

I'll already did this occasionally manually, but that of course does not
scale. Sometimes I wonder if it would be more efficient for nearly all
of us if subsystems just flushed their -fixes branch shortly before each
new -rc, as Linus apparently is not bothered by PRs that contain just a
change or two. But that of course creates work for each of the subsystem
maintainers, unless they creates scripts to handle that work nearly for
free (it seems to me the x86 folks have something like that).

Of course that would mean...

...that nothing big or slightly dangerous should be merged to -fixes
branches on Fridays.

Ohh, sorry, I was not clear here, as that would be totally wrong --
fixes definitely should go through the subsystems trees, as they have
the knowledge and the infra to check them (hmm, maybe a dedicated tree
might make sense for the smaller subsystems, but let's ignore that).

What I meant was just a tree those distros could merge into their
kernels to quickly resolve issues that upstream is slow to fix. But that
obviously has downsides, too. And is yet more work.

I have for the kernel overall, but nothing subsystem specific. But that
is pretty high on my todo list, as...

...I'm very well aware of this. :-/

Ciao, Thorsten
