Dear hid-playstation maintainers,

Could you please have a look at the enclosed patches for the DualShock 4
driver in hid-playstation, and upstream them if possible?


There is one bugfix, and a few small patches to enable third-party
controllers. They sometimes don't implement features that they
semantically "don't need", but which currently trip the driver.

For example, for the DualShock 4, we don't actually need to know the
firmware version in order to work with the gamepad - unlike with the
DualSense, which has different driver logic depending on the version.


Finally, there are two patches to add a DS4 compatible controller with
an unassigned VID/PID - I'd appreciate your thoughts on that.


If I can make it easier to upstream these patches, please let me know.

Thanks!

Max
