Marco replied in private and allowed me to forward his reply:

```
I can't since, as mentioned previously, this is the only AMD laptop
device that I have.
I am sure this is a regression for me, even if the issue is firmware
related. I have tested the 5.17 stock arch kernel and the sensor is
gone. With the last three patches reverted the sensor is back and
working fine.

I would love to verify if the issue is hardware or software related, but
being outside of AMD and with AMD not releasing any public information
with datasheet/specification on their Sensor Fusion Hub I really can't
say anything specific.

This still remains a regression, since the hardware was working before
and now it doesn't.

By the way, I already have seen also this rework of this specific driver
https://github.com/conqp/amd-sfh-hid-dkms that even added a still
missing handler for the lid sensor switch for disabling touchpad and
keyboard, and all efforts tried to merge it upstream with all sorts of
issues.

Regardless of everything, this is a driver supported in kernel by AMD
engineers, so all of this doesn't matter. On my hardware this three
patches break a previously working hardware.
```

Ciao, Thorsten
