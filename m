Thanks for doing this.

So... a bit of rationale. The keyboard does not really fit into the
LED subsystem; LEDs are expected to be independent ("hdd led") and not
a matrix of them.

We do see various strange displays these days -- they commonly have
rounded corners and holes in them. I'm not sure how that's currently
supported, but I believe it is reasonable to view keyboard as a
display with slightly weird placing of pixels.

Plus, I'd really like to play tetris on one of those :-).

So, would presenting them as auxdisplay be acceptable? Or are there
better options?

Best regards,
								Pavel
