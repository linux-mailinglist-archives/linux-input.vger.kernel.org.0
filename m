We have two ways of filling missing parts:
1) update the original source of DSDT (firmware or bootloader,
   whichever provides that);
2) adding an overlay.

The 2) works _if and only if_ there is *no* existing object in the tables.
In such cases, you can simply provide a *full* hierarchy. See an example of
PCI devices in the kernel documentation on how to do that. I believe something
similar can be done for USB.

It would be nice if you can run `grep -H 15 /sys/bus/acpi/devices/*/status`,
filter out unneeded ones, and for the rest also print their paths:
`cat filtered_list_of_acpi_devs | while read p; do grep -H . $p/path; done`

With this we will see what devices are actually present and up and running
in the system and what their paths in the ACPI namespace.

Not sure I understand the term "export" here. We need a description
of the (to describe) missing parts.

I have no idea what is the S30 node.
