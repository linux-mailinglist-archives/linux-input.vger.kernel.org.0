Hey! That's great! PineNote support would be awesome

Hmm... That's annoying. This series now works with the rM2 and a kobo
device, so I don't understand why it wouldn't work on the PineNote.

I just sent a v5 (sorry, I forgot to CC you) that has some code
cleanups, but I don't expect it to fix the issues you are seeing.

Cool! I'm impressed you got this working!

If the PineNote and eInk setups are different (they probably are if
this series isn't working for you) then there might be other changes
as well.

I'll leave that for an I2C HID maintainer to answer.

We will need that won't we? So then i2c_hid would have to implement
that as well?
