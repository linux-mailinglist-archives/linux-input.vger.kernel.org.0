Maybe I should clarify what I meant: All I2C operations start with the 
master writing the slave address to the bus. When a slave reads its own 
address off the bus, it pulls the data line low to ACK. If no device is 
present on the bus with the specified address, the line stays high which 
is a NACK. This means that on the bus level, we have a clear error 
condition specifically for no device with the specified address being 
present on the bus.

Whether the operation used is a dummy read or our first actual write 
should not matter - if the address is not acknowledged, the device is 
not present (or able to talk I2C). The problem lies in whether this "no 
device present on bus" error is reported clearly to us: Some drivers use 
-ENXIO specifically for this, some use it also for NACKs on written 
data, some report it but use other return codes for it, etc.

Even if we stick to the smbus probe in the long run, if we get to the 
point where we can rely on the error codes from I2C drivers we would be 
able to correctly log and propagate other error classes like bus errors 
or I2C driver issues which are all currently silenced as "nothing at 
address" by the smbus probe.

Good point. My main focus is also quirky behaviors we have added to 
replicate Windows behavior, the smbus probe just stood out in my bus traces.

I already sent 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240429233924.6453-1-kl@kl.wtf/ which goes 
back to improving the bus probe.
