I have tested my patch with a standard Wayland/Gnome UI and I didn't see
any issues because of hidraw. I tried rmmod/modprobe cycle, no trace
appeared and mouse worked well after.

It would be nice to check whether hidraw actually works or not. In
particular, I see that we don't implement .raw_request() hook for
mousevsc (mousevsc_hid_raw_request() exists but always returns 0). I
tried 'hid-example' from samples/hidraw and it gives me:

# ./hid-example

but I can't really tell if this is totally broken or not. In case it is,
your approach to get rid of hidraw sounds reasonable, I can probably try
it early next week or so.
