[CCing the regression list, as it should be in the loop for regressions:

Hi, Thorsten here, the Linux kernel's regression tracker.

How did you identify these three commits? Or do you just suspect that
it's one of them?

And did you try to check which of the three is the actual culprit?
Either by reverting them on top of master or by checking the parent for
each of the commits (git show '2f2bd7cbd1d^' shows the parent for
2f2bd7cbd1d).

Why not bisect between .127 and .136 then?

A bug report like yours can do the trick sometimes, as it might be
enough to ring a bell for one of the developers. But given that nobody
replied yet it looks like that is not the case. Then you most likely
will need to perform a bisection to identify the exact commit that broke
things.

FWIW, I'm currently working on a new document describing the bisection,
maybe it's of help for you:
https://www.leemhuis.info/files/misc/How%20to%20bisect%20a%20Linux%20kernel%20regression%20%e2%80%94%20The%20Linux%20Kernel%20documentation.html

Ciao, Thorsten

P.S.: To be sure the issue doesn't fall through the cracks unnoticed,
I'm adding it to regzbot, the Linux kernel regression tracking bot:

#regzbot ^introduced v5.10.127..v5.10.136
#regzbot title HID: lenovo: Lenovo ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard
sometimes sends middle-click
#regzbot ignore-activity

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)
