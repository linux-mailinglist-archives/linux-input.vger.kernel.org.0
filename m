Hello José,

nice hearing from you. I was actually thinking of just asking if you
want to take my patch under your wing, since you seem to be doing a lot
of uclogic related work. But your idea is even better, just submitting  
my patch once everything has settled down seems to be the way to go.

You are actually the first person to ever contact me about this. I was  
pretty worried that the patch is no good, but then I saw that there is  
quite a backlog in the maintainers patchwork and some of your patches
haven't been reviewed either. Originally I tried showing it to Nikolai,
but he said he was rather busy too and then some guys in the Digimend
project tried to get me interested in some userspace driver that works  
around all the issues of like init-packets and stuff. I always imagined
the kernel as this highly organzied, well-structured endeavor where
things would be quickly scrutinized and suggestions offered to assure 
the highest quality. Yet here we have two web developers working on the
graphics tablet driver. Let me say that it's really great you take the
time and effort to mainline these patches and help everyone enjoy their
tablets on linux!

On the technical side, the magic bytes really are very similar, the only
difference being the two additional trailing 0x00 for mine. Also my
tablet sends a response after activating this new interface which can 
get interpreted as a button press if it's not discarded. Is there a nice
way to work around this, with subreports or anything?

Lastly, do you have an idea in which kernel version the bulk of your
patches will have been merged, just so I know when to start looking at
this again? I don't mean to belittle the kernel maintainers of course,  
for I am sure they have more pressing and difficult issues on their
plate, like eBPF and such.   

Lets fixie wixie this fucksy uppsy!

Bye


Stefan Berzl
