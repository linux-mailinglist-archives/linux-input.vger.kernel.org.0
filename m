No worries. These things happens, and that's why we revert patches when
there is an issue.

Also, note that this issue is 2 fold:
- for sure, your driver was too greedy
- but also Fedora disabled i2c-designware which is used in many machines
	disabling the touchpad entirely

So you didn't break all of the other touchpads. The Fedora config change
did. Your driver just prevented the fallback mode to happen.

Yes. And this is already too far. If you are in the ->init(), that means
that you are dealing with a PixArt touchpad. If it's not, that means
that you should have stopped at ->detect() before.

I was merely the messenger here. But that debug patch will not help
you IMO. In pixart_read_tp_mode() you call ps2_command(ps2dev, param,
PIXART_CMD_REPORT_FORMAT); assuming that no other brand will answer that
command.

Turns out that it's not the case, so you can not rely on this only to
detect your touchpads. Especially because the test after looks for the
value "1" in the first byte, which is definitely not special.

A safe way to get this driver in (but painful as hell) is to rely on
dmi_matching. This way you have an allowlist of platforms where the
devices are known to be there, and then you can be sure you are talking
to your devices.

Or you have a safe magic sequence like elantech.c or alps.c where you do
a set of commands or expect a command to return a set of data that you
can be sure only PixArt touchpads will have.

Ideally if one commands returns the vendor name "PixArt" in ascii, that
would be perfect :)

Benjamin
