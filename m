I did some experiments with your proposal (letting SW debounce get 
programmed) and everything seems to work fine*.  I think you're right 
that setting a double debounce would be worst one wins.

I think we can revisit double debounce if a situation arises.

* I did find a problem at wakeup with a spurious event, and I'll include 
a patch in the next spin of my series for it.
