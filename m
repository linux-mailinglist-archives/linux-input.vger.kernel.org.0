I think that's a great idea. Not every DSP-equipped device has a write
sequencer, but most, if not all write-sequencer-equipped devices have
a DSP. Adding the write sequencer code to cs_dsp.c seems like a natural
union of the two facilities.

Maybe the solution here is to define a "descriptor", that is a struct which
reserves members for all things that can vary based on device (FF callback
pointers, input device capabilities, etc.). You then define an array of such
structs, with L50 being the only member, and L26 and others to come. Then,
cs40l50_vibra_probe() would simply parse the array index based on the device
ID hinted to it by the parent MFD.

As the person not doing the actual work, my naive opinion is that you face the
same problems whether two different drivers reference a library, or a common
driver supports two devices. The problem is therefore cosmetic, and if so, we
should tend toward a design pattern that seems to be most common in the input
subsystem, which is to support as many devices as possible with a single driver.

I very much support moving in incremental steps; if you still feel strongly
against my suggestion, let us by all means evaluate your approach in the
context of the other changes.

Got it, that makes sense. Presumably, the act of adding or deleting waveforms
directly manipulates XMEM and YMEM regions of the DSP, and we cannot do so while
they are actively being read during playback. Acknowledged on all counts.
