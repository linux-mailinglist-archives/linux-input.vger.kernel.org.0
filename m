TWIMC: this mail is primarily send for documentation purposes and for
regzbot, my Linux kernel regression tracking bot. These mails usually
contain '#forregzbot' in the subject, to make them easy to spot and filter.

#regzbot invalid: bios bug and reporter seems to be satisfied by
resolving this with a bios update

First bad commit causing it is https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/hid/amd-sfh-hid/amd_sfh_pcie.c?id=b300667b33b2b5a2c8e5f8f22826befb3d7f4f2b. Reverting this and the the other two on top fixed this. Tried to not revert only the above mentioned commit, but it's still not working.
