Yes, that plus: if id_table is present, use that for module aliases,
otherwise use driver name. In fact, I checked the platform core and it
seems to proceed in exactly this way when determining whether there is a
match. And while autoloading and probing are two different things, I
assume that we always want to consider a module for autoloading when we
know that it will probe because we have a compatible device.

Yes, sorry, I meant autoloading.

Well probably not, otherwise it would work here too, no? Unless there
are some fundamental differences in this between PCI and platform
drivers. But the input driver is platform too and is required through
the MFD cell, so I think it should be the same scenario.

OK, I see, thank you. I think this was the main source of my confusion
because I looked at other drivers for reference when trying to
understand which properties (name/device table) are necessary for what
action (probing/autoloading).
