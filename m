This patch from Basavaraj Natikar seems to solve the issue for me:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-input/20241003160454.3017229-1-Basavaraj.Natikar@amd.com/

Tested-by: Chris Hixon <linux-kernel-bugs@hixontech.com>


My original report:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/3b129b1f-8636-456a-80b4-0f6cce0eef63@hixontech.com/

Reported-by: Chris Hixon <linux-kernel-bugs@hixontech.com>


Thanks!

Note: I don't think it's a Fedora issue. I've had the problem on multiple
