The first one is not just adding the structure, it's also a clean
refactor of the existing code where the battery information is nicely
regrouped into a single struct. And if that patch is all by itself, we
can again bisect it because we know it's not supposed to break anything
because there is no functional changes. So yes, no changes in bahavior
seems pointless but it is very important for your next patch so it's
reviewable.

Up to you. I didn't mean necessarily to make the devm changes right now.

In an ideal world we would have:
- first patch which convert the existing code into devm
- second patch which introduces struct hid_battery
- third patch with the multi-battery feature.

But the order doesn't really matter (except 2 needs to come before 3).
The devm patch can be inserted anywhere. Having it first will simplify a
bit your 2 other patches, but having it last is also fine because we can
see the cleanup easily as well.

So if you want to postpone the devm patch, that's fine by me. But the
more you postpone it the higher the chances are that you forgot one kfree
or introduced a use-after-free, which means a lot more complications for
everybody :)

Cheers,
Benjamin
