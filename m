Hi Max,

Sorry for the late response, but I have been on vacation and just got back.

Analog buttons are as you know, fairly common on game controllers. For
this reason, I was working on this about 5 years ago as my company had
a need for it, but the need died out. I did send a proposal at the
time to linux-input, which I encourage you to look at ('Proposal to
support pressure sensitive "analog" buttons in evdev' on linux-input).
There are some good comments in there.

The summary of the discussion and also my thoughts is not to simply
reuse existing axes, but think of things in a bigger picture. In
particular I brought the example of analog keyboards into the
discussion at the time (Wooting made one) in which ALL buttons are
analog. The landscape has probably changed and I haven't caught up.
Quickly looking it looks like Razor now has one too and there are
probably more.

The key question is what are the similarities between these analog
devices. It feels it are not 'just' axes. There might be some level of
configurability (though not all of that) for example some keyboards
seem to use it as a way to trigger digital key presses at configurable
thresholds among others. Please look at the old discussion as there
were some good suggestions there if I recall from Peter Hutterer among
others.

Thanks,
Roderick
