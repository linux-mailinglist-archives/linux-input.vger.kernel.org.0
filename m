This heuristic was introduced in a commit that reads:
"
Hardcode wacom battery devices as not power-supply devices
    
We'll switch to a kernel property when the power_supply interface is
fixed.
"

Might be time :)

Whatever the type of "power_supply", the device will never be detected
as supplying the system, as the "scope" is correct.

Worse case scenario, the tablet is detected as something other than a
tablet. If that happens, please file a bug against upower and attach
the output of "udevadm info --export-db" and CC: me on the issue, and
I'll fix the detection.
