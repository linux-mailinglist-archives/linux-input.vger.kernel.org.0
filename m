Subject: [PATCH 00/12] i2c-hid: fixes for unnumbered reports and other improvements

Hi,

This series came about after I reviewed Angela's patch that fixed issues
with incorrect handling of high-numbered reports (15 and above) in
i2c-hid driver:

- it appears to me that the driver did not handle unnumbered reports
  correctly as the kernel internally expects unnumbered reports to be
  still prepended with report number 0, but i2c_hid_get_raw_report() and
  i2c_hid_output_raw_report() only expected report ID to be present for
  numbered reports.

- the driver tried to consolidate both command handling and sending
  output reports in __i2c_hid_command() but the rules for different
  commands vary significantly and because of that the logic was hard to
  follow and it bled out from __i2c_hid_command() to callers. I decided
  to introduce a few simple helpers and have the data encoding for
  individual commands done at the call site. I believe this made it
  easier to validate the rules and the logic and allowed to remove
  special handling for the HID descriptor retrieval, among other things.

- the driver does too many copying of data; encoding the data for
  commands at the call site allowed to only copy data once into the
  transfer buffers.

I tested this on a couple of Chromebooks with i2c-hid touchscreens, but
it would be great if other folks tried it out as well.

Thanks.
