Sorry for not answering, I was off in August until just now.

I tried you series just before taking time off, but the problem was that
my automation relies on this driver to not be too far from the current
upstream, as I need to patch it to be able to inject a node child in it.

Which is why I was very interested in the ACPI/DT work so that I do not
have to patch the driver.

Long story short, I'm not able to test it right now (and I got quite
some backlog as you can imagine). IIRC the code was fine, so I think we
can just take the series as is, and work on the quirks (if any) later.

Cheers,
Benjamin
