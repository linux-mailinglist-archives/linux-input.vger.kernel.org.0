That's exactly why I want to see the exact event flow. We can not do
"wild guesses" unfortunately (not meaning any offenses).
And I am very suspicious about the fact that the stylus reports 2
identical erasers. Because in the past David seemed to be able to have
2 distincts behaviors for the 2 "buttons" (physical button and eraser
tail).

I must confess, being the one who refactored everything, I still don't
believe this is as simple as it may seem. I paged out all of the
special cases, and now, without seeing the event flow I just can not
understand why this would fix the situation.

And BTW, if you have a tool affected by 276e14e6c3, I'd be curious to
get a hid-recorder sample for it so I can get regression tests for it.

I don't want to be rude, but this feels very much like black magic,
especially because there is a comment just below and it is not
updated. So either the explanation was wrong, or it's not explaining
the situation (I also understand that this is not a formal submission,
so maybe that's the reason why the comment is not updated).

The kernel is supposed to transfer what the device is. So if it says
this is an eraser, we should not try to change it. Users can then
tweak their own device if they wish through hid-bpf or through
libinput quirks, but when you install a fresh kernel without tweaks,
we should be as accurate as possible.

My main concern is that now we have a device which exports 2 different
interactions as being the same. So either the firmware is wrong, and
we need to quirk it, or the kernel is wrong and merges both, and this
needs fixes as well.

Once every interaction on the device gets its own behavior, userspace
can do whatever they want. It's not the kernel's concern anymore.

BTW, David, were you able to do a revert of 276e14e6c3?

Cheers,
Benjamin
