I've pushed an update of the file[0], turns out I made several mistakes.
As a general rule of thumb, you can follow the MR I've opened at [1],
click on the pipeline, open the last job ("make release"), then browse
the artifacts and pull the file from there.

I've fixed that one normally. There were a couple of issues:
- the PID in use was the one from the pro 16 gen2, which explained why
no change was appearing
- I've now decided to not export the second button as an eraser, as
mentioned above.

I flip the stylus on eraser hovering the canvas, Krita shows the Eraser ico=

Definitely my mistake: both the bpf programs I wrote were attached to
the same device. Thus, the 2 fixes were stacking on each other,
leading to some interesting side effects.

You can check that the bpf are properly loaded by having a look at the
report descriptor when you replug the device:
if you see "Secondary Barrel Switch" at offset 16 instead of "Eraser"
on both of your tablets (with hid-recorder), you should have
successfully patched your devices.

Cheers,
Benjamin
