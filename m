Hi Dmitry,

This patch is a bit of a kludge, but the problem it fixes has been
encountered on 2 different models now, so it seems that we really
need a workaround for this.

This patch applies on top of these 2 patches:

"Input: soc_button_array - Add active_low setting to soc_button_info"
"Input: soc_button_array - Add support for INT33D3 tablet-mode switch devices"

Which I have posted multiple times upstream already (they are from May!),
but these have not been getting any attention.

The soc_button_array code really is x86 specific glue code to translate
various incarnations of gpio-keys in ACPI tables to gpio_keys_platform_data.
As such I wonder if it would not be better to move this driver to
drivers/platform/x86?

I seem to be doing most if not all of the recent work on soc_button_array,
and soon I will be a co-maintainer of drivers/platform/x86. So having it
there and adding me in MAINTAINERS as maintaining it seems to be best?

If you want I can do a patch moving soc_button_array to drivers/platform/x86
and then add the other 3 patches on top and then we can merge all of this
through drivers/platform/x86?

Regards,

Hans
