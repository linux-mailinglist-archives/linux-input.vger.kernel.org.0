Ohh. This is an obsolete limitation.
38 was the number since we used half page optimization
for bpf trampoline.
It's gone now. We can easily lift this max.

Could you add more details to these ideas?
I thought you wanted bpf prog writers to be independent of each other.
They would tell some framework HID device id/pcie id that they need
and the rest would be automatic.
Maybe we can achieve that by adding another layer before libbpf
that would accept (bpf_prog, hid_id) tuple and insert
if (hid->id != hid_id) return -E..;
as the first insn into bpf_prog before loading into the kernel.
All such progs will be kfunc-s attached to the same hook.
The kernel will execute them sequentially.
The framework will provide demux by auto-inserting this 'if'.
This 'if (hid)' could be a part of sample code too.
We can simply ask prog writers to follow this style.

Another idea would be to do something like libxdp.
Attach a "dispatcher" bpf prog to the kfunc hook and use
some library to attach hid-specific progs as "freplace" kind of
programs. It's a more involved solution.

Another option is to use tail_calls.
If hid_id is a relatively small number. The "dispatcher" bpf prog
can do bpf_tail_call(prog_array, hid_id)
while hid specific progs insert itself into prog_array
instead of attaching to kfunc.

There are few lsm hooks in bpf core. It probably wwill be eird
for hid core to hook into them. We can add a few tracepoints
at attach functions if that helps.
