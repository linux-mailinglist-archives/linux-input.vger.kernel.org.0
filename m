Interesting stuff; thanks for sharing that background information.

MFD seems like the right (i.e. scalable) solution if A2H is on the roadmap.
In early L25 days, very early adopters simply asked for a sysfs control
exposed from the core (then LED !!) driver to enable/disable I2S streaming
mode, but this got hairy in case customers needed to control BCLK/Fs ratio,
bit depth, etc. during runtime.

From my naive point of view, maybe the solution looks something like this:

* drivers/mfd/cs40l50-i2c.c: I2C client
* drivers/mfd/cs40l50-spi.c: SPI client
* drivers/mfd/cs40l50-core.c: common tasks such as FW loading, OTP management, etc;
  perhaps L26 can leverage it as well
* drivers/input/misc/cs40l50-vibra.c: FF-specific support (name as you like, I just
  picked what seems to be most common)
* sound/soc/codecs/cs40l50-codec.c: codec-specific support

In case I have misunderstood, please let me know.

Since L50 can work out of the box without FW, another option is to follow the
approach used by some codec drivers and wait to load FW until the first request
to stream I2S, and/or trigger an FF effect in this case. By that point, rootfs
has been available for some time and request_firmware() will succeed.

This is advantageous because even though request_firmware_nowait() can solve
the deadlock problem for FW loaded at probe, it could still return -ENOENT right
away on some platforms. The disadvantage is that the first effect would be very
delayed due to the overhead of transferring several kB of FW over I2C for the
first time. That's OK for audio applications, but not haptics where delay normally
must be within single-digit ms.

Ultimately, I think the right approach is to look for FW from probe as you have
done, but use request_firmware_nowait(). However, I recommend structuring the
driver such that rip-up would be minimal in case you had to retry FW loading from
the first FF trigger, to support a customer whose rootfs is not available at probe.
In such a case, the customer could work around the first-time latency problem by
triggering a dummy effect early in their boot (e.g. init.rc).
