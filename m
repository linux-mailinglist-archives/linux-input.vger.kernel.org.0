Hmm, I am not sure there is such an existing architecture you could
use in a simple patch.

rmi-driver.c does indeed create an input device we could use to toggle
on/off the PM state, but those callbacks are not wired to the
transport driver (rmi_smbus.c), so it would required a little bit of
extra work. And then, there are other RMI4 functions (firmware
upgrade) that would not be happy if PM is in suspend while there is no
open input node.

So I think this "hack" (with Mika's comments addressed) should go in
until someone starts propagating the PM states correctly.

Cheers,
Benjamin
