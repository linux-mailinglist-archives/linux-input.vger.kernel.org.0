Yes I did work on that, but then the other way around making sure
that the i2c-hid driver would not bind to some devices which need
the elan_i2c touch*pad* driver.

And indeed as Dmitry points out:

I did fix a similar problem for the touchscreen driver last year or so.

I agree with Dmitry that we should try to avoid DMI matching here;
and I also agree that having some header with a static inline
acpi_is_hid_device() device helper would be good.

I'm a bit worried about the acpi_is_hid_device() approach though,
there is a lot of copy and pasting going on when vendors create
ACPI tables and sometimes a "PNP0C50" CID is present combined
with a valid i2c-hid _DSM method even though the device is not
an i2c-hid device, also see the i2c_hid_acpi_blacklist[] in
drivers/hid/i2c-hid/i2c-hid-acpi.c .

It seems to me that the problem is that the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7
is using what seems to be a very generic "ELAN0000" ACPI hardware
id instead of one of the many more specific ones.

So we could limit the acpi_is_hid_device() check to just the
"ELAN0000" ACPI hardware id I guess?

So I see the following 2 options:

1. Add an unconditional acpi_is_hid_device() check to elan_probe()
   and watch out for any bug-reports that this is causing breakage
   elsehwere
2. Add an acpi_is_hid_device() check to elan_probe() for ACPI enumerated
   touchpads with a hardware-id of ELAN0000 only; and still
   watch out for any bug-reports that this is causing breakage
   elsehwere just to be sure

Regards,

Hans
