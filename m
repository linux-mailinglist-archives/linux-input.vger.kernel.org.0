Hi Benjamin,

Thanks for all the information.

Yes, I can. I've done it for the two tablets and you can find the file outp=
ut hosted here:
https://www.peppercarrot.com/extras/?dir=3Dmailing-list/hid-records

I followed the diagnostic method (for gestures) and file naming suggested i=
n the short videos on this page:
https://digimend.github.io/support/howto/trbl/diagnostics/

I hope that it will be useful, even after the detailed feedback from Eric G=
ouyer (folays@gmail.com) on the ML (thank you).

You are right. I hope that the Wayland session will offer possible command =
line tools to customise devices. But that's another topic. :)

I'm thinking of my other display tablet, the XPPEN 16 Artist Pro (Gen2). In=
 this case, the stylus has the top button as an eraser, and an eraser tip a=
s well, as you can see in this photo 2. Was it also a decision by XPPEN to =
include this signal in the hardware, knowing that they already had an erase=
