Ok, so I'll submit a patch adding the 15c1 product-id for the
INTEL_ALPINE_RIDGE_LP_2C_XHCI controller to the list of ids for which we
set the XHCI_DEFAULT_PM_RUNTIME_ALLOW quirk. To fix the much too high
idle-power consumption problem on devices with this Alpine Ridge variant.

Ok, Matthias what do you think about this?
