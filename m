Since the spec is from Microsoft I expect it to be a x86 only thing
(AFAIK this predates there couple of ARM attempts). Also since this has
some tie-in with toshiba-acpi (at least for the laptops you are actually
testing this on) keeping it in the same dir as toshiba-acpi seems to
make the most sense to me.

A lot of ACPI drivers actually live under drivers/platform/x86 for
similar reasons.

I'm mostly just parroting (repeating) the party-line here. Not making
new drivers an acpi_driver is typically requested by Rafael, the ACPI
maintainer. Rafael can you explain why?

From my own view point I guess this has to do with ACPI having changed
over time from mostly offering firmware interfaces which mostly talk
to the EC, to actually also describing the hw.

Now a days of lot of ACPI devices are actually describing real hardware
devices, e.g. PCI cards, I2C devices, SPI decices and UART attached devices
including things like IO / MMIO addresses, I2C slave addresses, SPI chip
selects, GPIOs, IRQs, etc.

So the kernel now a days instantiates actual SPI / I2C / UART / PCI /
other(platform) devices for all the devices in ACPI, with all the physicial
resources attached to the struct platform_device / struct i2c_client / etc.
using the kernels standard resource mechanisms.

The struct platform_device / struct i2c_client / etc. devices then have
a firmware_node pointer (aka companion device) pointing to the ACPI
device in case the driver also needs to make some actual ACPI calls on
either to query some extra information stored in ACPI, or sometimes
to enable / disable special features driven through ACPI methods.

The instantiation of these struct platform_device / struct i2c_client / etc.
devices is done through a special default/fallback acpi_driver. If you
attach your own acpi_driver to an acpi_device then this will not happen.

So for any devices which also have some physical part (and not just pure
firmware interface) using an acpi_driver is not what you want. At which
point I guess we simply just want to avoid it even for pure virtual/fw
devices like the PNP0C32 case for consistency.

Note this is just my view on this, perhaps Rafael can explain this better?

Regards,

Hans
