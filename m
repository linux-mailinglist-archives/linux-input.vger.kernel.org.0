This is wrong (not your fault, of course). There is no way Blender
should directly talk to the input nodes. It should use the events from
the compositor, not randomly getting values from input nodes. sigh...

I got a quick look, and those events are coming from uinput. So their
Qt App is just a horrible user space driver to fix their tablet. Ouch.

The "raw" nodes are giving all of the information, but not correctly.
So they are using a separate userspace driver to "fix" it.

Yep, that part is correct and follows the specification

This is half wrong (spec-wise):
- tip switch should only be used when the actual tip is in contact.
- when using the rubber tip, we should get an eraser event :(

This is correct (as in it follows the spec)

In your case, the invert usage is correct.
In Illia's case, the invert usage is forwarded by the eraser usage, so
this is just plain wrong there.

This is not correct (again, according to the specification). XP-Pen
should report SecondaryBarrelSwitch (0x5a in the HID usage table[0])
And again, in Illia's case, this button should be reported as an
invert, and eraser when the tip touches the tablet.

Yes

yes

0

yes, but that's not correct, it should report eraser=3D1 when you touch
the rubber on the surface.

Yes, and I'd like to keep it that way, even if 6.6 and 6.5.8
apparently broke it.

So, to me:
- 276e14e6c3993317257e1787e93b7166fbc30905 is wrong: this is a
firmware bug (reporting invert through eraser) and should not be
tackled at the generic level, thus it should be reverted
- both of these tablets are forwarding the useful information, but not
correctly, which confuses the kernel
- I should now be able to write regression tests
- I should be able to provide HID-BPF fixes for those tablets so that
we can keep them working with or without
276e14e6c3993317257e1787e93b7166fbc30905
reverted (hopefully)
- problem is I still don't have the mechanics to integrate the HID-BPF
fixes directly in the kernel tree, so maybe I'll have to write a
driver for XP-Pen while these internals are set (it shouldn't
interfere with the HID-BPF out of the tree).

Benjamin
