Maybe it's retrying the same buffer a few times before finally giving 
up? The address does look like a plausible iommu-dma IOVA, so I can 
imagine at least two possibilities where a change in the IOMMU driver 
might have an impact:

- It's the right address in the right context but incorrectly mapped as 
DMA_FROM_DEVICE, where that previously had implicit read permission as 
well but is now write-only (can the Intel 2nd-stage format do that like 
Arm does? I forget...)

- It's the right address in the wrong context, because the DMA mapping 
was done with the wrong device, which was previously in the same IOMMU 
group as 00:1e.3, but now we assign groups differently. I don't know if 
lpss_spi_setup() is relevant to this particular hardware setup, but 
"dma_dev = pci_get_slot(dev->bus, PCI_DEVFN(PCI_SLOT(dev->devfn), 0));" 
there certainly catches my attention, at least.

The DMA mapping tracepoints should be able to shed light on how that 
address is mapped prior to the fault.

AFAICS it's a "write" at the SPI level, i.e. the SPI controller is 
sending data *to* the SPI device (the keyboard), so at the PCI/platform 
level the controller itself is fetching that data *from* memory.

Thanks,
Robin.
