Hi Illia, Jiri, Bagas,=20

Thanks to Jiri for forwarding my request for help to this mailing list.

I apologise in advance to Bagas and you all for not being able to properly =
configure my email client to follow the correct etiquette (Protonmail, unsu=
itable for kernel development, but we've made some progress with them on Ma=
stodon on the encryption issue [1]).

Thanks to Illia for the detailed explanation. Thanks also for fixing it, an=
d for explaining how the fix broke my workflow, and for your kind words abo=
ut the situation. I appreciate it.

However, after reading your reply, I still have my doubts about the prefere=
nce to put an eraser on the top button of the pen by default. But after a f=
ew days and re-reading your first sentence "The XP-Pen hardware reports the=
 Eraser usage for the upper stylus button.", I *think* I understood it: thi=
s is an internal signal that is sent by the device itself, and is therefore=
 a specification that has to be followed, right? In this case, it makes sen=
se for a generic driver to follow such a signal if it is sent by the hardwa=
re.

Having said that, behaving like this still makes no sense in one case: I'm =
thinking of my other display tablet, the XPPEN 16 Artist Pro (Gen2). In thi=
s case, the stylus has the top button as an eraser, and an eraser tip as we=
ll, as you can see in this photo [2]. Was it also a decision by XPPEN to in=
clude this signal in the hardware, knowing that they already had an eraser =
tip? In this case, please let me know, as it sounds like a hardware problem=
 at the design stage and I have probably a way of passing on the informatio=
n to their technical team.

> You can still remap the eraser button to a right click using xsetwacom:

Unfortunately, it doesn't work.=20

Firstly, such tablets are often connected to a computer that already has a =
display. So each device (pen/eraser) needs to be mapped to the correct disp=
lay and set to the correct 'Area' for calibration. A better syntax in my ca=
se to test your workaround is written like this:

tableteraser=3D"UGTABLET 24 inch PenDisplay eraser"
xsetwacom set "$tableteraser" MapToOutput "DisplayPort-2"
xsetwacom set "$tableteraser" Area 100 120 32794 32797
xsetwacom set "$tableteraser" "Button" "1" "3"

Secondly, forwarding the eraser button 1 to button 3 (a right click) in xse=
twacom doesn't work.=20

Pressing the button switches the device to an eraser and no right click hap=
pens. You'll need to hold down the button and click with the tip of the pen=
 to create a right-click event.=20

In a digital painting session in Krita, the software will switch your devic=
e to an eraser tool preset while you hold down the button, and the feedback=
 on the canvas will be the eraser cursor. You'll then have to click "with t=
he eraser" to get the right-click that triggers the pop-up palette [3].

I'd also like to mention that if you haven't correctly mapped and calibrate=
d your eraser device with xsetwacom, as I did in the code snippet above, th=
e cursor will by default jump to a different location when you hold down th=
e eraser button. It can be on a different display.

Finally, in the case of the XPPEN 16 Artist Pro (Gen2) with a real eraser d=
evice (Photo, [2]), the setting 'xsetwacom set "$tableteraser" "Button" "1"=
 "3"' will affect both erasers. Flipping the stylus on the eraser side and =
entering in 'hover' mode will return a correct eraser, but as soon as you s=
tart erasing with the tip, a right click will also be entered.

> You can also do this with "xinput set-button-map", which works for libinp=
ut as well.

$ xinput list
=E2=8E=A1 Virtual core pointer   =20
=E2=8E=9C   =E2=86=B3 UGTABLET 24 inch PenDisplay Mouse         id=3D8    [=
slave  pointer  (2)]
=E2=8E=9C   =E2=86=B3 UGTABLET 24 inch PenDisplay stylus        id=3D10   [=
slave  pointer  (2)]
=E2=8E=9C   =E2=86=B3 UGTABLET 24 inch PenDisplay eraser        id=3D17   [=

$ xinput set-button-map 17 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
$ xinput get-button-map 17
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3

Even after that, it doesn't work. My original article [4] mentions in the l=
ast paragraph that I have tested almost all methods, and this was one of th=
em. Even a udev rule doesn't fix it. For reference, xinput produces the sam=
e behaviour as xsetwacom: you have to hold the button (it triggers an erase=
r device switch) then click with the tip to get a right-click...

> We have tested this with several XP-Pen devices, including Artist 24.

Sorry if my tests show something different. Maybe there is something wrong =
with my GNU/Linux operating system (Fedora 38 KDE spin). Let me know if you=
 have any idea why I get these results and guide me with what distro I shou=
ld switch to get a similar obsevation than you do (and also to report the i=
ssue to the Fedora team).

---

All in all (and in the case that my observations and tests are correct), I =
still stand by the points that I made in my blog post:

- I don't have any way to customise the hardcoded eraser buttons in userspa=
ce and **it is a problem**: for devices without a touchscreen or mouse, not=
 having access to a right-click by default on the device is a handicap. Man=
y actions on the D.E. and applications use the right click. The preference =
to replace it with an 'eraser switch' action by default is IMHO highly deba=
table here.
- In the case of a pen that already has an eraser tip on the other side of =
the device [2], it makes no sense to exchange the right-click top button fo=
r another way to erase. Also in userspace, there seems to be no way to dist=
inguish between the two buttons (the eraser tip and the eraser button). All=
 actions from xsetwacom, xinput/libinput target the two eraser devices, and=
 they target them unsuccessfully too.
