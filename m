My take away from this discussion that in a sleep state the power button
(or actually any wakeup source) should tell userspace "hey, we want to wake
up". It doesn't tell "hey, we want to wake to power off".
This sounds good to me as a user. Yes, if laptop is sleeping we need to wake
it up to continue, the power off is just a next step of this flow.
The  expected hot topic here is the longer presses of power button, but I think
if we have a timer and tell after say 3 second that the K_WUP was up and K_PW
is down is not a solution, it will be always flaky.

Just my 2c.
