Hi All,

Since I send this out, efi-next has seen some changes causing the first
2 patches to no longer cleanly apply. So it looks like we need to
merge this one bit at a time with immutable branches.

Ard, the first 2 patches in this series should be merged through your
efi tree. AFAIK everyone is happy with them in their current state
so they are ready for merging. Can you create an immutable branch
with these 2 patches and merge that into your efi-next branch?

Note if you do the immutable branch on 5.5-rc1 + just these 2 patches,
there will be a conflict when you merge this into efi-next, but it is
trivial to resolve.

Luis, the rest of the series is almost ready for merging, it just needs
your review of the 2 new patches (patch 5 and 6) adding the selftests for
the new firmware_request_platform api, if you can review those that would
be great.

Regards,

Hans
