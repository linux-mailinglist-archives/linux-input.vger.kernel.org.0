Right, the idea would be to only do this for the subset of children
that are panel followers.

It definitely doesn't seem ideal, but it also didn't seem too terrible to m=

No. The only reason you'd use panel follower is if the hardware was
designed such that the touchscreen needed to be power sequenced with
the panel. If the touchscreen can stay powered when the panel is off
then it is, by definition, not a panel follower.

For a laptop I don't think most people expect the touchscreen to stay
powered when the screen is off. I certainly wouldn't expect it. If the
screen was off and I wanted to interact with the device, I would hit a
key on the keyboard or touch the trackpad. When the people designing
sc7180-trogdor chose to have the display and touchscreen share a power
rail they made a conscious choice that they didn't need the
touchscreen active when the screen was off.

For the other hardware I'm aware of that needs panel-follower there is
a single external chip on the board that handles driving the panel and
the touchscreen. The power sequencing requirements for this chip
simply don't allow the touchscreen to be powered on while the display
is off.

One use case where I could intuitively think I might touch a
touchscreen of a screen that was "off" would be a kiosk of some sort.
It would make sense there to have two power rails. ...or, I suppose,
userspace could just choose to turn the backlight off but keep the
screen (and touchscreen) powered.

Yeah, I don't 100% know if it's doable but it seems possible.
Certainly it's something for future investigation.

Luckily, at the moment anything I'm aware of that truly needs panel
follower also doesn't have multiple sources for a touchscreen.

Sure. So I guess an "if" test plus a boolean state variable. I still
don't think it's a lot of complexity.

OK, I guess the -EPROBE_DEFER is technically possible though probably
not likely in practice. ...so that's a good reason to make sure we
request the IRQ in probe even in the "panel follower" case. I still
beleive Benjamin would prefer that this was abstracted out and not in
the actual probe() routine, but I guess we can wait to hear from him.

One last idea I had while digging would be to wonder if we could
somehow solve this case with "IRQF_PROBE_SHARED". I guess that doesn't
work well together with "IRQF_NO_AUTOEN", but conceivably we could
have the interrupt handler return "IRQ_NONE" if the initial power up
never happened? I haven't spent much time poking with shared
interrupts though, so I don't know if there are other side effects...
