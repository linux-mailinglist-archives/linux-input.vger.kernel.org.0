First, the reset gpio will be set before probe() returns, just not
immediately when it is requested.

[ Sure, your panel follower implementation may defer the actual probe of
the touchscreen even further but I think that's a design flaw in the
current implementation. ]

Second, the device is not necessarily in the "powered off" state as the
driver leaves the power supplies in whatever state that the boot
firmware left them in.

Not immediately asserting reset and instead leaving it in the state that
the boot firmware left it in is also no different from what happens when
a probe function bails out before requesting the reset line.

It avoids asserting reset before we need to and thus also avoid the need
to deassert it on early probe failures (e.g. if one of the regulator
lookups fails).

We also don't need to worry about timing requirements, which can all be
handled in one place (i.e. in the power up and power down callbacks).

These properties may prevent it from being used by the regulator
framework, but GPIOD_ASIS works well in the case of a reset gpio where
we simply leave it in whatever state the firmware left it in if probe
fails before we get to powering on the device.
