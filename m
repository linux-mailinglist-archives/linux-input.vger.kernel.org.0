That would work if OpenRGB gets to ship the LampArray bpf object (not
saying that it should). Because if OpenRGB is not installed, you'll get
a led class device, and if/when OpenRGB is installed, full LampArray
would be presented.

But anyway, BPF allows to dynamically change the behaviour of the
device, so that's IMO one bonus point of it.

Yeah, except we don't have the fallback LED class. If you are confident
enough with your implementation, then maybe yes we can include it as a
driver from day one, but that looks like looking for troubles from my
point of view.

After a second look at the LampArray code here... Aren't you forgetting
the to/from CPU conversions in case you are on a little endian system?

good question :)

I would say, probably not in the WMI driver itself. I would rather have
a hid-tuxedo.c HID driver that does that. But even there, we already had
Linus complaining once regarding the report descriptors we sometimes
insert in drivers, which are looking like opaque blobs. So it might not be
the best either.

Sorry I don't have a clear yes/no answer.
