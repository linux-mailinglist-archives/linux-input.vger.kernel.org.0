I think we've a bit of miscommunication going on here.

My proposal is to add a "no_hw_debounce" flag to 
struct gpio_keys_platform_data and make the soc_button_array
driver set that regardless of which platform it is running on.

And then in gpio_keys.c do something like this:

diff --git a/drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c b/drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c
index f9db86da0818..2788d1e5782c 100644
--- a/drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c
+++ b/drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c
@@ -552,8 +552,11 @@ static int gpio_keys_setup_key(struct platform_device *pdev,
 		bool active_low = gpiod_is_active_low(bdata->gpiod);
 
 		if (button->debounce_interval) {
-			error = gpiod_set_debounce(bdata->gpiod,
-					button->debounce_interval * 1000);
+			if (ddata->pdata->no_hw_debounce)
+				error = -EINVAL;

+				error = gpiod_set_debounce(bdata->gpiod,
+						button->debounce_interval * 1000);
 			/* use timer if gpiolib doesn't provide debounce */
 			if (error < 0)
 				bdata->software_debounce =

So keep debouncing, which I believe will always be necessary when
dealing with mechanical buttons, but always use software debouncing
(which I suspect is what Windows does) to avoid issues like the issue
you are seeing.

My mention of the BYT/CHT behavior in my previous email was to point
out that those already do use software debouncing for the 50 ms
debounce-period. It was *not* my intention to suggest to solve this
with platform specific quirks/behavior.

<semi offtopic>
Hmm, I did found one interesting thing looking at further DSDTs
the Dell Venue 10 Pro 5056 DSDT actually specifies a non 0
debounce time in the ACPI0011 device's GPIO descriptors
it uses a value of 30 ms. This device being one of the few
actually specifying a debounce time in the ACPI is ironic
since it uses drivers/pinctrl/intel/pinctrl-cherryview.c
which does not support PIN_CONFIG_INPUT_DEBOUNCE...
