Sorry, this was not meant as a criticism really, but you mentioned
yourself that there isn't anything in the works yet, you just have some
plans.

For such a project to succeed Lenovo needs to invest into selling
devices with Linux as a primary operating system, and it has to be
consumer segment (or small business, because for corporate they
typically roll their own support channels). The case of retrofitting
Linux onto a that device originally came with Windows OS rarely gets
much if any response from the normal support channels.

Is this something that is actually happening?

The keycode space is finite and extending bitmaps leads to more memory
consumption and weird breakages (like uevent generation exceeding 4K
memory page resulting in failures). I am trying to balance need for new
keycodes with how likely they are to be used.

Thanks.
