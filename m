It can be quite hard to predict how large an object ACPI methods will
return. Even if you get it right for your laptop model it may fail
on other models. So using ACPI_ALLOCATE_BUFFER here (which I assume this
is about) is absolutely fine, I would even say it is a good idea :)

Hmm, since you have already written / ported the wakeup_cause code
I would prefer to retain it.

You could add a module_param (boolean, default off) to enable this using
a is_visible callback which returns 0 as mode when the boolean is not set
(thus hiding the wakeup_cause sysfs attribute).
Then people can easily test this on other models and if it turns out to
be useful (and works as is) then we can drop the parameter and just
always enable this.

That is not the prettiest of solutions, but this way we atleast preserve
the work/functionality from the staging driver.

I think it would make sense to use the ID from GHID here, yes, then you
could simplify your hwdb entry to:

evdev:name:Quickstart Button *:dmi:bvn*:bvr*:bd*:svnTOSHIBA:pn*Z830:*
  KEYBOARD_KEY_xxxx=prog1
  KEYBOARD_KEY_xxxx=prog2
  KEYBOARD_KEY_xxxx=touchpad_toggle

This also looks a bit nicer then needing one entry per button.

Note that if you do this you need to generate the sparse-keymap
on the fly for it to contain the GHID scancode. Userspace can
only modify mappings for scancodes which are present in the
sparse-keymap.

Using prog1 / prog2 is fine here. Although I think if you look at all the possible
keycodes you may find closer matches. E.g. you could use battery / KEY_BATTERY for
Eco mode and maybe KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE for the "switching to projection mode" key.

I think replacing the 64 bit code with a warning that 64 bit values
are not supported is going to be the best thing to do if you chose
to use the GHID as keycode.

If you plan to be available for maintenance / review of this driver
going forward; then yes please add a MAINTAINERS entry and also consider
adding your name + email to the MAINTAINERS entry for the toshiba_acpi
driver.

I think defaulting to KEY_UNKNOWN here is fine and otherwise this is
fine too.

You could drop this if you generate the scancode from the GHID since then
it will be duplicate info with the scancode. OR if you prefer you may
keep it. I have a slight preference for dropping it, but your choice.

See my answer above.

Extending the existing quirk table for this is fine, I don't see any
other way to easily do this.

Thank you for your work on this!
