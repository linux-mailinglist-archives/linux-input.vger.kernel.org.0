Teaching systemd-backlight about mulicolor backlights might be a nice project
too. But their use case seems to be more about screen backlights as it seems.
Did I overlook something here?

Oh and yeah, IMHO another argument could be that obviously at some point
the LED management could be removed from those user space tools, as the
kernel would already know about them.

After all the LED class devices should be there for a reason ;-)
