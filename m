Not quite, I only flash the RW_LEGACY section, so only the payload is 
changed as the vendor firmware unfortunately does not ship with a 
depthcharge alternative making booting another operating system 
impossible. (Or I missed something.)

Sorry for mixing the terminology. (On the identical in design Dell 
Latitude 5400 it is that key.)

Oh, interesting choice.

(As I was unfamiliar with `scale`, after pressing it, you see an 
overview of the currently opened windows on the current virtual desktop.)

Thank you, in what Chromium repository is that file? Do you know the 
reason, why these are not upstreamed to udev/systemd?

Yes, that is what I described in the bug report.

 From `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/inet` from *xkb-data* 2.33-1:

```
partial alphanumeric_keys
xkb_symbols "chromebook" {
         include "level3(ralt_switch)"
         key <FK01> {    [ XF86Back ] };
         key <FK02> {    [ XF86Forward ] };
         key <FK03> {    [ XF86Reload ] };
         key <FK04> {    [ F11 ] };
//        key <FK05> {    [ F5, F5, F5, F5 ] }; // Overview key
         key <FK06> {    [ XF86MonBrightnessDown ] };
         key <FK07> {    [ XF86MonBrightnessUp ] };
         key <FK08> {    [ XF86AudioMute ] };
         key <FK09> {    [ XF86AudioLowerVolume ] };
         key <FK10> {    [ XF86AudioRaiseVolume ] };
         key <BKSP> {    [ BackSpace, BackSpace, Delete ] };
         key <UP>   {    [ Up, Up, Prior, Up ] };
         key <DOWN> {    [ Down, Down, Next, Down ] };
         key <LEFT> {    [ Left, Left, Home, Left ] };
         key <RGHT> {    [ Right, Right, End, Right ] };
         key <LWIN> {    [ Super_L, Super_L, Caps_Lock, Super_L ] };
```

This layout is different from the one used on google/sarien. How many 
different layouts are there, and how do you organize them in Chromium OS?

Thank you for the clarification.


Kind regards,
