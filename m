oh okay, thats the only type of driver that I found did a similar

I know I was picking an specific HID++ feature, over the many others

Yes, what I mean, it that there's no path to make the multi-battery
reporting native to Linux(Other than ofk you can report only the
lowest of the average of all batteries, but not individual batteries),
so I feel manufactures have no other option other than write their own
perfiferal-sw (eg, steelseries sonar, Logitech GHUB, etc.)(and sure,
many of those dont even work on linux, but then we are left
reverse-engineering protocols in Solaar, HeadsetControl and others).

Well, BS maybe, but completely human fabricated :p
And sure, I have no ground in reality for this supposition other than
inferring from the peripherals that I've seen. But my questions here
mostly is, why would manufactures spend time and money creating and
maintaining their custom protocols and accompanying desktop-software
if there was a native way? But I guess you got to the same conclusion
as I did, so then, I'll remove my suppositions, and only keep the real
world examples.

yeah, but I guess we are also showing the way of how it could be
implemented in a future device,  so might as well stress the
theoretical aspect of it, so we can provide a well rounded api. For
now I'll work on a v3 with report ID, but I'm open to changing things
around if we come up with something better.

Got it, I was mostly worried that it was expected somewhere else, but
given your feedback, I'll make sure to have a proper new api without
so many edge case handling for a single device.

Mostly to say, "Hey I know it has been done there!", but I'll get rid
of those in v3 as its just noise.

Thank you for the bikeshedding, and sorry for such a long cover
letter, I just wanted to justify every aspect of what/why/how was

is there.

Best,
Lucas Zampieri
