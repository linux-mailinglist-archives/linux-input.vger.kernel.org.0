So thinking more about this, I believe that the module param would be
over kill and I think it is best to just keep this with the suggested
changes from the review added.

If it works on other models then it might be useful to some users;
and if it turns out to not work then we can change/fix it without
worrying about breaking existing users of the API since if it does
not work in the first place then there won't be any users.

Hans
