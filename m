There actually aren't that many that I'm aware of.

Note that this gpio_keys KEY_POWER evdev event generation
on resume issue goes way back until the last time we had
this conversation and it still has not really been fixed.

And I've not seen any bug-reports about the same problem
with any other drivers.

> What about acpi button behavior when using S0ix?

AFAIK it is the same as with S3, at least it is not
causing any issues. I've never seen the ACPI button code
cause re-suspend immediately on wakeup by what for all
intends and purposes is a spurious KEY_POWER event.

Last time we discussed this I wasn't really happy with
the outcome of the discussion but I just went for it
because of Android's reliance on the event and we
lacked a better plan.

Now that we've a fix for this in the form of KEY_WAKEUP
it is time to properly fix this instead of doing userspace
kludges.

The key-down event is send as KEY_WAKEUP instead,
so userspace sees KEY_WAKEUP pressed not KEY_POWER.

And atm it is actually doing a shitty job of reporting
hwevents because there is no way for userspace to be able
to differentiate between:

1. User pressed power-button to wakeup system
2. User pressed power-button after resume to do
   power-button-action (e.g. suspend system)

Even though *the kernel* does *know* the difference.

So the suggested change actually makes the kernel
do its job of reporting hw-events better by making
the reporting more accurate.

ATM if I resume say a tablet with GNOME and then
change my mind and press the power button within
3 seconds of resume to suspend it again the second
power-button press will outright be ignored

The current userspace workaround is racy like this,
again the whole workaround in GNOME is just an ugly
kludge which I did back then because we couldn't
agree on a better way to deal with this in the kernel /
because just suppressing sending KEY_POWER would break
Android.

The suggested use of KEY_WAKEUP is lightyears better
then doing ignore KEY_POWER events for xx seconds
after resume which is simply always going to be racy
and always was just an ugly hack / never was
a great solution.

Hans
