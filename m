ACPI/x86 system does not necessarily mean something running generic
Linux distribution, and it may have different set of devices and
drivers. Or it may even use soc_button_array and still not want this
behavior.

You only consider one environment: Gnome. There are other alternatives.
For example on Chrome OS pressing power button for longish time (but
shorter that forced power off) will result in orderly system shutdown.

Yeah, it will break everyone who is monitoring user activity.
