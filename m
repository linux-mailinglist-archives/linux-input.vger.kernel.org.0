Cool, let's do that. I'll cc you on the last batch of patches so you
get notified when they get merged.

Well, the kernel is well-structured, but as you mentioned, there is a
*lot* of work on the maintainers side and I think there is not a big
community supporting this driver. It's normal that it takes some time
to get everything reviewed.

Same here, my tablet responds with: 02 b1 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00.

In my case, button presses look like: 02 F0 XX XX 00 00 00 00 00 00.
Because of the 0xF0 subreport, I think this data gets ignored, but I'll
do some extra testing just in case.

How did you test it?

I couldn't tell, I can imagine that 5.19 or 5.20. Anyway, I'll cc you
so you can have a good idea about what's going on.
