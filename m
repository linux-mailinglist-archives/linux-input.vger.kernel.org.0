No one expects forced internal review on mature contributions. We talk
here about a first time contribution where already basic mistakes were
made: like not using get_maintainers.pl, not using checkpatch, not using
other tools and finally sending code which does not look like Linux
kernel code at all.

I don't know who is exactly core team, who is partner. I see
"google.com" domain, so Google folks are responsible for not wasting
time of the community. If Google disagrees, please change the domain so
I will understand that and not feel like Google wants to use us all. I
am fine and I understand if small companies or individuals make such
mistakes. It feels like a waste of our time if Google makes such
mistakes. Google's (Alphabet's) revenue for 2022 was 282 billions USD
and net revenue was 59 billions USD.
