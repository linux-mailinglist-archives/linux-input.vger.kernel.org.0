Hi, this is your Linux kernel regression tracker.

I noticed a regression report in bugzilla.kernel.org that afaics nobody
acted upon since it was reported about a week ago, that's why I decided
to forward it to the lists and all people that seemed to be relevant
here. It looks to me like this is something for Basavaraj, as it seems
to be caused by	b300667b33b2 ("HID: amd_sfh: Disable the interrupt for
all command"). But I'm not totally sure, I only looked briefly into the
details. Or was this discussed somewhere else already? Or even fixed?

To quote from https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215744 :

> After updating to 5.17, the input from the accelerometer disappeared, completely. No devices available from IIO tree. First bad commit causing it is https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/drivers/hid/amd-sfh-hid/amd_sfh_pcie.c?id=b300667b33b2b5a2c8e5f8f22826befb3d7f4f2b. Reverting this and the the other two on top fixed this. Tried to not revert only the above mentioned commit, but it's still not working.

Anyway, to get this tracked:

#regzbot introduced: b300667b33b2b5a2c8e5f8f22826befb3d7f4
#regzbot from: Marco <rodomar705@protonmail.com>
#regzbot title: input: hid: input from the accelerometer disappeared due
to changes to amd_sfh
#regzbot link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215744

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.

Additional information about regzbot:

If you want to know more about regzbot, check out its web-interface, the
getting start guide, and the references documentation:

https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/
https://gitlab.com/knurd42/regzbot/-/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md
https://gitlab.com/knurd42/regzbot/-/blob/main/docs/reference.md

The last two documents will explain how you can interact with regzbot
yourself if your want to.

Hint for reporters: when reporting a regression it's in your interest to
CC the regression list and tell regzbot about the issue, as that ensures
the regression makes it onto the radar of the Linux kernel's regression
tracker -- that's in your interest, as it ensures your report won't fall
through the cracks unnoticed.

Hint for developers: you normally don't need to care about regzbot once
it's involved. Fix the issue as you normally would, just remember to
include 'Link:' tag in the patch descriptions pointing to all reports
about the issue. This has been expected from developers even before
regzbot showed up for reasons explained in
'Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst' and
'Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst'.
