From rules.d/99-systemd.rules.in:
# Pull in backlight save/restore for all backlight devices and
# keyboard backlights
SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", TAG+="systemd", IMPORT{builtin}="path_id", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}+="systemd-backlight@backlight:$name.service"
SUBSYSTEM=="leds", KERNEL=="*kbd_backlight", TAG+="systemd", IMPORT{builtin}="path_id", ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}+="systemd-backlight@leds:$name.service"

And from the NEWS file for systemd 243:
        * systemd-logind now exposes a per-session SetBrightness() bus call, 
          which may be used to securely change the brightness of a kernel
          brightness device, if it belongs to the session's seat. By using this
          call unprivileged clients can make changes to "backlight" and "leds"
          devices securely with strict requirements on session membership.
          Desktop environments may use this to generically make brightness
          changes to such devices without shipping private SUID binaries or
          udev rules for that purpose.

It's clear that it's not just displays.
