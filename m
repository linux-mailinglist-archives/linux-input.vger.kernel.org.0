More correctly, any .o that is listed as being built as part of
hid.o should is going to be controlled by CONFIG_HID and should
not its own have a Kconfig symbol at all.

E.g. here:
 hid-y                  := hid-core.o hid-input.o hid-quirks.o
hid-core, hid-input, and hid-quirks don't have their own
Kconfig symbols.

I only know of two possibilities though there may be more.

a. use request_module(true, "hid-haptic");

This would probably be used in the hid core somewhere, afterthe device matching is done.

b. use udev. When a device that needs hid-multitouch is
discovered, have udev load both hid-haptic and hid-multitouch.


I see that hid-haptic.h is written so that it has stubs for
when CONFIG_HID_HAPTIC is not enabled. Can hid-multitouch
operate (in a reduced capacity) when HID_HAPTIC is not enabled?
So that they are separate modules and hid-multitouch is not
dependent on hid-haptic?

There is probably a use case for hid-multitouch without having
hid-haptic loaded since hid-multitouch existed without having
hid-haptic around at all.

It seems that you want both of them loaded. And then Lucas
has reported a build error when HID_HAPTIC=m and
HID_MULTITOUCH=y, so either (like Lucas said) HID_HAPTIC
should be bool, not tristate; or in Kconfig,
HID_MULTITOUCH should depend on HID_HAPTIC, which would not
allow the problem config that Lucas reported.
But that forces devices that want HID_MULTITOUCH to also
have HID_HAPTIC loaded, even though they may not need it.
