 From userspace there are the HIDIOCSFEATURE and HIDIOCGFEATURE ioctls.

 From the hid 1.11 spec:

"

7.2.2 Set_Report Request

[...]

The meaning of the request fields for the Set_Report request is the same as for
the Get_Report request, however the data direction is reversed and the Report
Data is sent from host to device.

"

and from the hut 1.5, some of the LampArray feature reports are meant to be used 
with set report and some with get report

(well as far as I can tell the hut doesn't actual specify, if they need to be 
feature reports, or am I missing something?)

and there is the pair with LampAttributesRequestReport and 
LampAttributesResponseReport.

Sorry for my confusion over the hid spec.
