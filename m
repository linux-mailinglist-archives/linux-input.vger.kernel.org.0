Note that there are currently some IDs missing from the xHCIs which
are part of the TCSS too. At least the id for the xHCI in the thunderbolt
controller on the Lenovo T14 gen 1 is missing. I started a discussion
about extending the kernel quirk list for this vs switching to hwdb
a while a go:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/b8b21ba3-0a8a-ff54-5e12-cf8960651086@redhat.com/

The conclusion back then was to switch to hwdb, but I never got around to this.

If we are also going to enable this for the non TCSS Intel XHCI controllers,
maybe just uncondtionally enable it for all Intel XHCI controllers, or
if necessary do a deny-list for some older models and enable it for anything
not on the deny-list (so all newer models). That should avoid the game of
whack-a-mole which we will have with this otherwise.

Note the deny-list + enable anything not on it approach could be done
either in the kernel or in a udev-rule + hwdb combo.

Hans
