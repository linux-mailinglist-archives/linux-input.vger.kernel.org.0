Yes, I think this is a great idea as we have many instances where
the same entries are present in several tables.

It did indeed, I am not sure why. This does not invalidate what Hans
said - lately I was not able to spend as much time on input as I wanted.

Regarding this patch - it looks like board names are pretty unique in
many cases, so I wonder if we could not save some memory by omitting the
vendor info (especially because some, like "Notebook", are very generic
anyways) and go simply by the board.

Thanks.
