Sure.

No need, we now have symbol namespaces [0]. You can use that then.

Great.

That's incorrect.

tools/testing/selftests/firmware/fw_fallback.sh - tests sysfs fallback
tools/testing/selftests/firmware/fw_filesystem.sh - tests direct loading

The fw_fallback.sh should probably be renamed to something like
fw_fallback_sysfs.sh and you could have your own script for this
new API.

What the scripts do is *configure* a test type in userspace and then
trigger the test. It should pretty trivial to add an entry to enable
your API to be used. The benefit of this is that we can then tweak
*how* we test the API in userspace, and kick a trigger.

Doing a new module could be done but we'd have to answer why we can't
implement the test with the test knob interface currently used.

Right, the syfs for for that test driver is just to *configure* the
test in userspace, nothing to do with the firmware API. The firmware
API is then *used* once the trigger is used.

That would be fantastic, thanks!
