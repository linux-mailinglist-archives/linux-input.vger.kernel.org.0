Hmpf, euhm euhm I'm not entirely sure what makes sense. From the
sounds of it are somewhat broken devices (buggy firmwares on them) or
perhaps one of your controllers (the one with not working touch) is
perhaps broken.

Some of the patches like handling report id 0x1 (minimal) won't hurt,
the LED fixes won't either. It makes it easier to add more devices. I
wonder if we have fully have enough data.

Need to think a bit...
