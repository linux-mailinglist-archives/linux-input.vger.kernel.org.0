Hi Krzysztof,

and sorry about the late reply. Got side-tracked.

A name like 'retain-state-shutdown' would also be too specific as what
I'm describing here is that the reset line should be (or can be) left
deasserted whenever the OS wants to power off the device.

That could be during suspend, but more generally whenever the OS
determines that the device does not need to be powered (e.g. when
closing a character device).
