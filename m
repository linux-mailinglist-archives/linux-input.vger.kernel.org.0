Yes we are working on that one. This is the last driver we need to allow
disabling the regulator, afterward it should hoepfully work on our
target system.

Sorry for the confusion. As it is configured now, it can not work as
wakeup source in deep sleep mode. Touch is completely disabled.

So to not change the default behaviour I would have to name it:
atmel,slow-wakeup
or maybe even full wakeup because it does a wakeup from the disabled
state?
atmel,full-wakeup

Exactly, the added code looks more or less exactly as you wrote. And on
resume it does the opposite + configure it:

resume():
  if (!wakeup_source):
     enable_regulators()
     configure_maxtouch()

Stefan
