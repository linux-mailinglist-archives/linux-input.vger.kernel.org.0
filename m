A use-case is Chromebooks which do want to execute 'w', 's',
wait 1000ms and then 'c' under one key combination. Having that supported
upstream brings us one little step closer to those machines running
upstream kernel.

Another argument for such a "macro language" is when a machine's system
keeps degrading over time, possibly degrading (relatively) fast.
"Raising Elephants Is So Utterly Boring" consists of 6 actions, each
of which requires pressing several keys. The user might be unable
to complete all the 6 steps, while a "macro" requires user's involvement
for carrying out just one step.

Regards,

Andrzej
