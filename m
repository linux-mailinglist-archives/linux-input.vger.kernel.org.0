Many people have looked into fixing this, but X11 is a network protocol, and
the other side could be a many many years old X-terminal (one of those devices
which don't have their own OS but connect over xdmcp to show a desktop
running on some big machine somewhere else on the LAN).

XKB in X is layered on top of the original X input protocol, and the data
gets passed around multiple times in multiple different structs and it is
limited to a 8 bit wide int everywhere.

Note it is not just micmute. The F13 - F24 F-key range has been used to
work around this for a while now.

I'm aware of the following "mappings" being used for this:

evdev	->	interpreted by userspace as

KEY_F20 ->	mic-mute toggle
KEY_F21 ->	touchpad on/off toggle
KEY_F22 ->	touchpad on
KEY_F23 ->	touchpad off

This is not pretty, I know.

Regards,

Hans
