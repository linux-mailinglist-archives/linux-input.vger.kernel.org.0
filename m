great. Do you wish to make any changes to your original series? If not,
please let me know and I will use the v2 [1] as it is.

I see. I think the reason why I thought what I wrote before is that
downstream the regulator DTS lives separately from the board as a .dtsi
file which made me think that it can be used universally. So if I
understand correctly now, the hardware specifications of the regulator,
such as the minimal and maximal voltage should be part of the driver,
while the DT should contain requirements for the given use of the
regulator (with a specific board) - is this correct?

I would expect that in the case you describe, the kernel would set the
voltage to a value which would satisfy both the ranges. I don't know
what would happen if that was not possible (i. e. there was no
intersection in the two requested voltage ranges), though. Or does a
call to regulator_set_voltage set the voltage immediately taking notice
only of the hardware contraints? I think I am having trouble
understanding what this quote from the regulator_set_voltage
documentation means:

> If the regulator is shared between several devices then the lowest
> request voltage that meets the system constraints will be used.

But actually, it probably doesn't make sense that the kernel would try
to resolve a range suitable for all calls to this function as, I assume,
a single driver could call it multiple times with disjoint voltage
intervals.

Thank you for your patience.

Kind regards,
K. B.
