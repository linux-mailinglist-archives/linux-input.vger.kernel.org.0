I've been testing and trying out `suspended` flag. But this flag gets set very late.
If we depend on it, we'll not be able to wakeup in time after cancelling hibernation.

Initially we were using hibernation_in_progress() in RFC and we switched to
pm_sleep_transition_in_progress() in order to cancel the sleep as well (which wasn't 
the original intention).

The sleep detection isn't working through pm_suspend_target_state or pm_suspend_in_progress()
as it is set very late in suspend process. While hibernation_in_progress() gets set in
start of hibernation.

Then as you said, they are unreliable. I'm thinking what other options. But I've not
found any. Please share ideas what other way can work instead of suspended flag better?
