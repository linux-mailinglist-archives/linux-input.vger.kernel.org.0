Asking this again.

Is there a full list somewhere of all the Bluetooth devices that
support HID++ or a way to detect them so we can avoid the piecemeal
approach currently taken:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-input/20220404100311.3304-1-hadess@hadess.net/

Once we know for certain what all those Logitech devices are, we can
start blocking them in upower or bluez.

Cheers
