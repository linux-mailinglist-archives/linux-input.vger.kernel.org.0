So -- we already have very similar displays in
drivers/auxdisplay. drivers/auxdisplay/cfag12864b.c is 128x64 display,
1-bit display for example.

It is quite close to orthogonal. I'd suggest simply pretending it is
orthogonal grid with some pixels missing :-). We already have
cellphone displays with rounded corners and holes in them, so I
suspect handling of missing pixels will be neccessary anyway.

As you say, there are other displays with similar problems.

Yep. We need some kind of extension here, and this is likely be quite
vendor-specific, as animations will differ between vendors. I guess
"please play pattern xyzzy with parametrs 3 and 5" might be enough for this.

This will need fixing for cfag12864b.c, no? Perhaps userspace should
simply ignore anything smaller than 240x160 or something...

Well, at least we have good UAPI to work with. Other options were 100
files in /sys/class/leds, pretending it is a linear array of leds,
just passing raw data around, and pretending it is grid of RGB888
data.

Anyway, there are devices such as these: (8x8 LED display).

https://www.laskakit.cz/8x8-led-matice-s-max7219-3mm-cervena/

We should think about what interface we want for these, and then I
believe we should make RGB keyboards use something similar.
