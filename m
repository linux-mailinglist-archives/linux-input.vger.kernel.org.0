Is that because of the huge good/bad list that Windows has for USB mice?
Or is it this way now on Windows for _ALL_ USB mice?

We have been loath to make this change because not all USB mice could
support this, as well as the "wake up a laptop in a backpack that gets
the touchpad touched" issue.

This is a big change, how many different systems and devices did you
test it on?  What about userspace tools that previously assumed the old
behavior?

Why change this now 20 years later?  What changed to require this now?

In short, unless there is a really good reason now to make this change,
we shouldn't for all the reasons we never did so in the past.  Oh, and
proof of loads of testing will be required as well.
