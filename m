Ok, I just realized that we may have some miscommunication here,
when you wrote:

"Since our limitation is the init process must have mostly finished,
  it implies early x86 boot code cannot use this, what measures can we
  take to prevent / check for such conditions to be detected and
  gracefully errored out?"

I assumed you meant that to apply to the efi_check_md_for_embedded_firmware=
()
helper or its caller.

But I guess what you really want is some error to be thrown if someone
calls firmware_request_platform() before we are ready.

I guess I could make efi_check_for_embedded_firmwares() which scans
for known firmwares and saved a copy set a flag that it has run.

And then combine that with making efi_get_embedded_fw() (which underpins
firmware_request_platform()) print a warning when called if that flag
is not set yet.

That would mean though that some code which runs earlier then
a core_initcall would, would call firmware_request_platform() and
such code is generally expected to know what they are doing.

I just checked and the cpu microcode stuff which comes to mind
for this uses a late_initcall so runs long after efi_get_embedded_fw()
and I have a feeling that trying to use the fw_loader before
core_initcalls have run is going to end poorly anyways.

Still if you want I can add a pr_warn or maybe even a WARN_ON
to efi_get_embedded_fw() in case it somehow gets called before
efi_check_for_embedded_firmwares().

Regards,

Hans
