Another issue is whether wakeup for a mouse means pressing a button or 
just moving the mouse.  For a mouse that uses LEDs to sense motion, 
moving it won't generate a wakeup request -- USB suspend does not allow 
the mouse to use enough current to keep the LEDs illuminated.  On the 
other hand, there's no reason why wakeup by pressing a button shouldn't 
always work.

Also, the patch description doesn't seem to appreciate the difference 
between the default value for the wakeup setting and actually supporting 
wakeup.  As long as the hardware supports it, the default wakeup setting 
doesn't matter all that much, because the user can change the setting 
during system startup or whenever he wants.  But if the hardware doesn't 
support wakeup then the default setting makes no difference at all.
