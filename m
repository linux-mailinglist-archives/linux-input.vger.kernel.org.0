The parent device can be a hid device, a wmi device, a platform device etc. so I 
thought it would be nice to have some unified way for identification.

Ack

My train of thought was that it would be nice to have the use_leds_uapi at a 
somewhat unified location in sysfs. The parent device can be of any kind, like I 
mentioned above, and while for deactivating it can easily be found via 
/sys/class/leds/*/device/. For reactivating, the leds entry doesn't exist.

Ok, I will see when I start implementing.
