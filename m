Note that on x86 wakeup events and GPIO IRQs typically use a different
event mechanism / path under the hood (PME events to resume from suspend).
It is not just a case of marking the IRQ used while running as a wakeup
source.

So it is possible that setting the hw-debouncing is in some way interfering
with the reporting of x86 PME events while the system is suspended.

Most systems where soc_button_array is used don't support hw-debouncing
in the first place, so on most systems this change is a no-op.

As such I'm in favor of the fix for this from the v3 series to disable
hw-debouncing in gpio_keys.c when used from soc_button_array.c code.

Regards,

Hans
