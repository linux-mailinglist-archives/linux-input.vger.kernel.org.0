After more thoughts about Niels' email, the whole thread and a
not-so-good night's sleep, I think I now understand what is the
problem.

And yes, most of the problem comes from that remap *after* the kernel
parsed the device and made a decision based on what was provided to
it.

I think it would be best not to require the need for the ioctl in the
first place.

Looking at David's blog, I'm starting to wonder if we actually need to
report BTN_TOOL_RUBBER after all in the case where there is no Invert
usage.

Right. So maybe instead of trying to force the "no Invert" pens into
the "oh, this looks like an eraser", maybe we should remap in that
case the eraser usage into a secondary barrel switch.
We then need to filter the proximity out event that is sent when the
user presses it, but all in all it should be doable (hopefully).

OK, thanks for the confirmation.

I just had a meeting with Peter Hutterer, and he told me it would be
best if the kernel doesn't follow the entire "this button is an eraser
mode". But that requires some filtering of the events because some
hardware (like the Artist 24 here) partially implements the
"specification" by sending a proximity out event when the button is
pressed.

So my idea would be to do that change in HID-BPF, so that it's only
included when libinput supports it (no regressions then), and we can
actually change the heuristics more easily than having to patch the
kernel.

I'd also need to get the behavior of:
- stylus is in range -> second button is pressed -> stylus touches the
surface with the button still pressed -> button is released -> stylus
leaves the surface and goes out of proximity.
- stylus is in range -> stylus touches the surface without any button
pressed -> second button is pressed -> stylus leaves the surface and
goes out of proximity
- stylus is in range -> stylus touches the surface without any button
pressed -> second button is pressed -> second button is released ->
stylus leaves the surface and goes out of proximity

And probably some other weird corner cases.

If we get the "eraser" event being set to 0/1 when the button is
pressed whether the stylus touches the surface or not, it would be
simple enough to change the purpose of the button in HID-BPF and
filter the eventual prox out events.

Yeah, you're correct. This isn't a regression, it's a user tempering
with the kernel and the kernel can't deal with it.
But the use case is still valid. It's the way it was done that was wrong.

I still need to figure out what is wrong after my HID-BPF changes. But
yeah, it is orthogonal.
