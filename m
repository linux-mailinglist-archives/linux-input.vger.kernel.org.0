The program is actually simple: knowing that the kernel splits by
application collection, we can replace the second collection from being
exported as a mouse into a pointer:

See the branch hp_elite_presenter of https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/bentiss/udev-hid-bpf/-/tree/hp_elite_presenter

The program just replaces the byte 79 from 0x02 (mouse) to 0x01
(presenter):

---
SEC("fmod_ret/hid_bpf_rdesc_fixup")
int BPF_PROG(hid_fix_rdesc, struct hid_bpf_ctx *hctx)
{
	__u8 *data = hid_bpf_get_data(hctx, 0 /* offset */, 4096 /* size */);

	if (!data)
		return 0; /* EPERM check */

	/* replace application mouse by application pointer on the second collection */
	if (data[79] == 0x02)
		data[79] = 0x01;

	return 0;
}

Nope, no need. hid-recorder is what comes from the device, so the kernel
processing depends on my current tree, which explains how I can test the
various quirks :)

IIRC it was mostly because some devices were having separate
declarations for their input/output and features, and they were not
especially grouped together. The multi_input quirk splits features/input
/output in different devices, making it harder to configure (in case of
the multitouch ones, where to need to set an operating mode), and the
default was just having one input node for the whole HID device.
