So essentially all platforms using soc_button_array would always turn on 
software debouncing of 50ms?

In that case what happens if the hardware debounce was ALSO set from the 
ASL?  You end up with double debouncing I would expect.

Shouldn't you only turn on software debouncing when it's required?
