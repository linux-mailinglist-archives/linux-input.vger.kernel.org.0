That connotation lid was closed represent human will not use laptop and 
system must keep it was sleep and even though the laptop was 
accidentally awakened.

if system can doesn't consider lid open event and ignore the connotation 
about lid open event I think that system behavior is inappropriate. you 
don't think my patch was inapproriate that on some system doesn't 
consider lid open event.

In additon, if it doesn't include my patch and non-keyboard hid device 
doesn't make system wakeup by ohci. because ohci driver doesn't export 
wakeup property for usb slave device.

bios and kernel was two sets of things and they should has their own 
indepdent configuration.  if bios enable usb wakeup but wakeup is still 
not work well. Do you think it is appropriate?

in additon, The keyboard device is enabled by default, and other hid 
devices should also be enabled. Otherwise, it will be treated differently.
