It looks like SDL lacks the patch to deal with the upstream driver
properly. The chicken and egg problem SDL there is between the kernel
and SDL, is that SDL supports a device prior to there being a kernel
driver (or there being enough penetration for one). Without a driver,
many devices function with an often strange mapping. That's the
mapping SDL has in its table (for hid-generic). When a kernel driver
comes around with a different, but proper mapping there is an issue.

At the time we first dealt with this for DualShock 3 / 4 devices. The
trick used then was to patch the 'version' bit of the HID device with
'0x8000'. This resulted in a different mapping line. To understand SDL
uses a GUID as the index for the table, it is composed of
vendor/product id, version id and other fiels. The patched version,
resulted in a different GUID, which then allowed SDL2 to recognize the
device properly as it would use a different mapping line.

For the Switch controllers, it looks like no patched line was added.
Someone would need to provide a patch.
