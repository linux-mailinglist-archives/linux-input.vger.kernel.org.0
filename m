I think that using "status" is not a good idea, I find that confusing.

Perhaps we could have a node like

something {
	device-class-one = <&device1>, <&device2>, <&device3>;
	device-class-two = <&device4>, <&device5>, <&device6>;
}

so that'd be more or less

hw-prober {
	trackpads = <&tp1>, <&tp2>;
	keyboards = <&kb1>, <&kb2>;
	touchscreens = <&ts1>, <&ts2>;
}

Besides, something else I can suggest here is to make this more generic: actually,
this issue is spread across way more devices than you maybe think... for example,
I know of some smartphones that may have the same situation with DSI displays and
they're sometimes distinguished by an ADC value, sometimes by reading back the
manufacturer ID (or panel id) through DSI.

Also, if Chromebooks really need something "special", such as that coreboot sku-id
parameter, I think that this should be registered externally into the hw prober
and not embedded inside of the *generic* hw prober driver.

We can even reuse of_device_id instead of inventing a new hw_prober_entry struct...

Idea:

drivers/platform/chrome/cros_of_hw_prober.c

static int cros_sku_hw_prober(struct platform_device *pdev, const void *data)
{
	...this is your cros_sku_component_selector() function, anyway...
}

static const struct of_device_id cros_hw_prober_ids[] = {
	{ .compatible = "google,hana", .data = something },
	{ /* sentinel */ }
};

static int some_kind_of_early_init_function(something)
{
	int a,b,c,ret,something;

	.. some logic if necessary ..

	return of_hw_prober_register(cros_sku_hw_prober, cros_hw_prober_ids);
}


Btw, thanks for starting that. If this will be done the right way, it's going to
be useful to many, many people.

Regards,
Angelo
