Bagas, I know you mean well, but I think you are making things
unnecessarily complicated for both David and the developers here. Sure,
the mail Jiri quoted did not make it to lore, but whatever, for him it
was apparently good enough; and I suspect this "quote forwarding to
others" is good enough for the people he brought into the loop as well.
Yes, there are developers that don't want to go to a website for
details, but if that's the case it's likely better to ask for details in
this thread instead of opening a second one. And regression tracking can
work without a separate mail as well.

Ciao, Thorsten
