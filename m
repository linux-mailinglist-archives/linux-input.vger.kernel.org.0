Ideally, all but one driver in a group should bail out of probe quickly if
the device is not populated. If not, I would consider that to be a bug or at
least room for improvement in that driver.

The reason input devices can take a while to probe is because they may be
loading FW over I2C or performing some sort of calibration procedure; only
one driver in the group should get that far.

I recommend against spilling the solution into user space; it's simply not
practical for many downstream use-cases where platform engineers can tightly
control their own bootloader and kernel, but have limited maintainership of
user space which is likely to be shared by many other products.

Agreed with Rob here; in the case of a touchscreen, we're almost always
dealing with a module that connects to the main board by way of a flex
connector. Rarely do the bus and GPIO assignments change across alternates.

This solution seems a bit confusing to me, and would require more edits
to the dts each time a second source is added. It also means one would
have to write a small platform driver for each group of devices, correct?
I like the idea of a new "status" string; just my $.02.

Thanks for charting this path; I'm really excited to see a solution to
this common problem.
