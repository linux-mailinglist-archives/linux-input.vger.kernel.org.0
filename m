This seems like a real bug.  IMO you're right it should only be sending 
it when the key was received.

Actually a8605b0ed187 was about a runtime regression not a suspend 
regression.  I didn't change anything with sending KEY_POWER during 
wakeup handling.

FTR I did test Hans suggestion and it does work effectively (code below).
