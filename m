Your high-quality submissions make the review process efficient and

I think the list head belongs in the MFD's private data (cs40l50_private)
because the pseq code belongs in the MFD; more details as to why below.

I agree that in practice, the write sequencer would technically go unused
in a codec-only implementation. However, that is because the ASoC core
happens to write all pertinent registers ahead-of-time each time a stream
starts. That is a property of the ASoC core and not L50; my feeling is that
the driver should not be structured based on what one of the subsystems
associated with it happens to do, but rather the nature of the hardware.

Some specific reasons I think the MFD is a better home for the pseq code:

1. The write sequencer is a housekeeping function derived from the way
the hardware implements its power management; it doesn't have anything
to do with haptics. My opinion is that facilities supporting application-
agnostic functions belong in the MFD, for all children to access, even
if only one happens to do so today.

2. Over the course of the IC's life, you may be required to add errata
writes after the IC is taken out of reset; these presumably would need
to be "scheduled" in the write sequencer as well. These wouldn't make
logical sense to add in the input driver, and they would be missed in
the theoretical codec-only case.

3. This device has a programmable DSP; it wouldn't be unheard of for a
customer to ask for a new function down the road that begets a third
child device. Perhaps a customer asks for a special .wmfw file that
repurposes the SDOUT pin as a PWM output for an LED, and now you must
add a pwm child. That's a made-up example of course, but in general we
want to structure things in such a way that rip-up is minimal in case
requirements change in the future.

I'm not sold on the input driver and the methods in what is now an FF
library living in separate files; more on that below.

If the core functions (e.g. firmware loading and interrupt handling) of L26
and L50 are drastically different, then it's perfectly acceptable to have
different MFD drivers for the two. There are plenty of examples of devices
throughout MFD who are close cousins to one another.

Likewise, if the input-related functions of L26 and L50 are nearly identical,
then it's also perfectly acceptable for both drivers/mfd/cs40l26.c and
drivers/mfd/cs40l50.c to load drivers/input/misc/cs40l50-vibra.c, which
supports both L26 and L50 haptics-related functions. You're already doing
something similar, but I disagree on the following:

1. Rather than have a library referenced by two drivers that support children
which are largely the same in a logcial sense, just have a single driver that
supports two children.

2. That common code encapsulates too many things (e.g. pseq facilities). A
library may make sense, but not restricted to input children.

For code that is common to either MFD (e.g. pseq), it is largely a judgement
call and maintainer preference as to where that code lives. One approach could
be to simply include all common code in drivers/mfd/cs40l50.c today. When
drivers/mfd/cs40l26.c lands, it can simply #include <linux/mfd/cs40l50.h>, and
its Kconfig can select MFD_CS40L50. Both modules would get built, but only one
would bind and probe.

Another approach could be to move the pseq code from the L50 MFD into a library
(e.g. drivers/mfs/cs40l50-common.c) selected by both L50 and L26 Kconfigs. That
is of course some rip-up, but at least the code is not jumping subsystems at this
point, which it otherwise might if you leave it in an input library for now.

That being said, you are the one who is responsible for supporting the driver in
the future, so the decision is ultimately yours. You have a much better sense of
the hardware variants and the relationships among them. It's a delicate balance
of preparing for what customers may request, and any decision will inevitably be
wrong in some way :) I think the important thing is to not restrict yourself too
much up front, and my humble opinion is that slightly redrawing the dotted lines
in your "block diagram" may ease some pain down the road.

ACK. Good call on returning -EINVAL if update is true yet the entry was
never added; that seems like a reasonable level of protection.

Sure, but why do adding and removing waveforms require workqueues? The DA7280
driver doesn't do this; what is different in this case? (That's a genuine
question, not an assertion that what you have is wrong, although it seems
unique based on my limited search).
