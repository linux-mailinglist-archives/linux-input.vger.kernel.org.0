Surely things that can be done in userspace should be done there.
So we would envision an input daemon which reacts to a predefined
combination of keys. That said, it is not unimaginable to think of
userspace being dead enough (e.g. due to memory pressure) to be unable
to complete such a compound action. In other words userspace not being
able to do it is a good reason for putting the code in the kernel.

Dmitry has given a use case where such a compound action is needed.
