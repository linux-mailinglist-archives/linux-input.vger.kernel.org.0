This patch helps only if iforce_usb_disconnect() is called while waiting at
wait_event_interruptible(iforce->wait, !test_bit(IFORCE_XMIT_RUNNING, iforce->xmit_flags)).

It is possible that iforce_usb_disconnect() is called before
iforce_send_packet(iforce, FF_CMD_ENABLE, "\001") sets IFORCE_XMIT_RUNNING bit.

Protecting with a mutex does not help. It is possible that clear_bit(IFORCE_XMIT_RUNNING)
is called before iforce_send_packet() is called.

Right.

Not limited to clearing IFORCE_XMIT_RUNNING bit. We could introduce a new
bit for disconnect event and check both bits at wait_event_interruptible().

The author who added this wait_event_interruptible() call is Dmitry Torokhov.

      Input: iforce - wait for command completion when closing the device

      We need to wait for the command to disable FF effects to complete before
      continuing with closing the device.

Dmitry, what do you think? Even without iforce_usb_disconnect() race,
a joystick device not responding for many seconds would be annoying.
