It took me a few days but I finally understand that this report
descriptor is actually correct.

The descriptor gives an array of 1 element of size 8, which is enough
to give an index within the available values being [Digitizers.Ink,
Digitizers.Pencil, Digitizers.Highlighter, Digitizers.Chisel Marker,
Digitizers.Brush, Digitizers.No Preference]

Given that logical min is 1, this index is 1-based.

So the job of the kernel is to provide the event
Digitizers.Highlighter whenever the value here is 3. The mapping 3 <->
Digitizers.Highlighter is specific to this report descriptor and
should not be forwarded to user space.

I couldn't understand the fix you did in the BPF program. Can you
explain it by also giving me an example of raw event from the device
and the outputs (fixed and not fixed) of the kernel?


Talking about that, I realized that you gave me the report descriptor
of the Acer panel in an other version of this RFC. Could you give me:
- the bus used (USB or I2C)?
- the vendor ID?
- the product ID?
- and the same for the other panel, with its report descriptor?

This way I can add them in the testsuite, and start playing with them.

Hmm, not sure I follow this entirely. I guess I would need to have one
of such devices in my hands :(

As a rule of thumb, hid_hw_raw_request() can not and should not be
called in IRQ.
I tested your patch with a USB device, and got plenty of complaints too.

I know bpf now has the ability to defer a function call with timers,
so maybe that's what we need here.

Good question.
The plan I had was to basically pre-compile BPF programs for the
various devices, but having them separated into generic + vendor
specifics seems interesting too.

I don't have a good answer right now.

Cool thanks.

Yeah, this feels wrong to me too.
I guess what we want is to run a BPF call initiated from the
userspace. I am not sure if this is doable. I'll need to dig further
too (I am relatively new to BPF too as a matter of facts).

Benjamin
