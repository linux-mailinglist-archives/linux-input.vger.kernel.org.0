I've added the three test cases (dmesg + sudo monitor-sensor on all three t=
ests) on the bug report on bugzilla.kernel.org. One is with the stock kerne=
l from arch, 5.17.1. The other two is using zen patches on top of 5.17. One=
 is without the three reverts above mentioned. Sensor is missing still. The=
n my same custom configuration only with the three reverts applied. The sen=
sor is back and working.

If you need anything more, just let me know.
