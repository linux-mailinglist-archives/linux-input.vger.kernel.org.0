Ḯ'm well aware of that and it was mentioned in the commit message for
4367d763698c ("arm64: dts: qcom: sc8280xp-x13s: enable alternate
touchpad") as well as discussed briefly with Rob here:

Right, this will only work for fairly simple cases, but we do have a few
of those in tree since some years back.

Right, a proper solution will likely require an updated DT.

Indeed.

Yes, I agree that we'd need to take a broader look at this and not just
focus on the immediate pinctrl issue.

I expressed something along these lines in the thread above:

	It seems we'd need some way to describe the devices as mutually
	exclusive...

but given that we had prior art for handling simple cases and due to
lack of time, I left it on the ever-growing todo list.

But regardless of what a long-term proper solution to this may look
like, we need to fix the regression in 6.6-rc1 by restoring the old
behaviour.
