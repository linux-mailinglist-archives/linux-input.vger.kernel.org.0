After finally wrapping my head around how this all fits together:

Early in boot, you check a bunch of firmware descriptors, bundled with
drivers, to search EFI code and data for firmware before you free said
code and data.  You catalogue it by name.  Later on, you use this list
as a fallback, again catalogued by name.  I think it would be rather
nicer if you simply had a list in a single file containing all these
descriptors rather than commingling it with the driver's internal dmi
data.  This gets rid of all the ifdeffery and module issues.  It also
avoids any potential nastiness when you have a dmi entry that contains
driver_data that points into the driver when the driver is a module.

And you can mark the entire list __initdata.  And you can easily (now
or later on) invert the code flow so you map each EFI region exactly
once and then search for all the firmware in it.
