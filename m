With s2idle (rather then S3) we never really suspend, we just put
everything in an as low power state as possible and call halt on the
CPU and then hope that the SoC power-management-unit shuts of a whole
bunch of power-planes based on all the devices being in a low power
state.

This means that in practice with s2idle any device can be a wakeup
device since regular IRQs work fine as wakeup sources in s2idle.

This is what the s2idle support in the i2c-hid code is based on:
drivers/hid/i2c-hid/i2c-hid-acpi.c:

        if (acpi_gbl_FADT.flags & ACPI_FADT_LOW_POWER_S0) {
                device_set_wakeup_capable(dev, true);
                device_set_wakeup_enable(dev, false);
        }

So I did just test this on a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 carbon gen 8, which
uses i2c_hid_acpi as driver for its touchpad and if I echo
enabled to the wakeup attr there, then wakeup by touchpad does work.

One interesting thing there is that the touchpad ACPI node does not
have _PS0 and _PS3. Which means that the touchpad working as wakeup
device makes sense, since it can not be turned off at all.

So I guess we could extend the above check in the i2c-hid-acpi
code to read:

        if ((acpi_gbl_FADT.flags & ACPI_FADT_LOW_POWER_S0) &&
	    !adev->flags.power_manageable) {
                device_set_wakeup_capable(dev, true);
                device_set_wakeup_enable(dev, false);
        }

Because if there is a _PS3, which presumably is the case for
the troublesome touchscreen Raul is trying to fix, then we
will call that on suspend; and after that it is likely that
the device will not work as a wakeup source.

And I just checked the DSDT of a couple of devices where I'm
reasonable sure that the touchpad uses I2C-HID and none of
them define _PS0/_PS3 methods on the touchpad ACPI node.

So I think that the above suggestion should fix things
for the i2c-hid case.

I've added Kai-Heng, the author of the original change
introducing the device_set_wakeup_capable() call, to the Cc.
Kai-Heng what do you think about this ?

Raul, can you check if this resolves your issue?

FWIW here is an acpidump of the X1C8:
https://fedorapeople.org/~jwrdegoede/acpidump-lenovo-x1c8

Regards,

Hans


p.s.

An other interesting datapoint is that despite not declaring
a _PRW method the DSDTs which I've checked do all 3 contain
an _S0W method, returning 3 or 4. Which suggests that maybe the
ACPI code should look at _S0W even when no GPE is being used?
