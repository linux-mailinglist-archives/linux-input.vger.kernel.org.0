ASSALAMU'ALAYKUM!!!!!

I have a business proposal in the tune of USD$12.3m for you to handle with
me. I have opportunity to transfer this abandon fund to your bank account
in your country which belongs to our deceased customer.

I am inviting you in this transaction where this money can be shared
between us at the ratio of 45% for your kind assistance and 45% for me
while the remaining 10% will go to charity and the needy around us. Do not
be afraid of anything I am with you and I will instruct you on what you
will do to claim this fund.

Please kindly get back to me if you are interested.


My regards
Mr.James Jota
