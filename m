Thanks for looking into this! Bisecting has been slow on my end 
unfortunately. I built today's linux-next (20220726) with your proposed 
patch below and my drawing tablet curiously still does not work as 
expected. The stylus works a couple of times, but eventually stops 
working (unlike prior where it always seemed to only work once). Do I 
need both your revert and this diff for it to work properly?

Also, do you know whether the revert be backported to stable 5.18?
