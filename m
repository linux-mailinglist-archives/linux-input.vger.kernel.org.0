That's what the "hardware ids" database is supposed to be handling.
It's easier to manage this in userspace than in the kernel.

I just love systems where people feel it is safer to update the kernel
than it is to update a hardware database file :)

That's an Intel PCI device id.  If someone else is abusing that number,
I'm sure Intel would want to know about it and would be glad to go after
them.

But note, PCI devices can be behind lots of different types of busses,
so maybe the "can this device autosuspend" differs for them because of
different implementations of where the device is, right?

Submit a patch!
