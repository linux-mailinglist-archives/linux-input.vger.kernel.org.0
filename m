Oops sorry about that, obviously I did not run make dtbs_check on this
binding. I guess I just grepped so we don't have interrupt-names in use
right now.

OK

OK. So here's what gpio-keys currently allows:

1. gpios property with no interrupt in the dts, the driver tries to
   find the interrupt based on the gpio

2. gpios property with one interrupts property and no interrupt-names

And here's what we could allow in the binding with the wakeirq support
added:

1. gpios property with no interrupt in the dts, the driver tries to
   find the interrupt based on the gpio

2. gpios property with one interrupts property and no interrupt-names

3. gpios property with one interrupts property and interrupt-names = "irq"

4. gpios property with one wakeirq and interrupt-names = "wakeirq", the
   driver tries to find the io interrupt based on the gpio

5. gpios property with two interrupts and interrupt-names =
   "irq", "wakeirq"

So yeah we could only allow interrupt-names if there are two interrupts
like the attempted binding has. This would leave out #3 and #4 options
above. No need to limit these options from driver point of view though.
Any preferences on what the binding should have?

Tony
