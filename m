I think, the new behavior would be desirable by most distros. They don't care
about the old behavior. But its just my thinking. What do you think is the way forward?

Even if there are users which used to pressing power button during hibernation,
will not press it after a few tries if they really want the hibernation to complete.

That's in the plan. But who knows when we get time to attempt that. 

First I need a board/machine with serial console access to view all logs in real
time. :)
