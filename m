note that evdev is not HID, you get evdev event nodes for any input
device that's supported, regardless what the underlying protocol is.
HID is the incoming protocol, evdev is the outgoing protocol and the
limitation is in the translation from one to the other because they're
not 100% identical.

if you want to use HID, you can access the device via the hidraw node
but then you also have to do all the actual HID parsing etc. yourself.
and openign the hidraw node which currently requires root (or for
gaming(-ish) devices on logind an active session).

It's basically accepted that we need a proper solution for the current
evdev restrictions and that has been the case for years. I recall
David's ABS_MAX2 patches from 11 years ago:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/2/632

So *something* needs to be done but adding things like BTN_TRIGGER_HAPPY
and extending the ranges and filling other bits in just kicks the can
down the road another few years until it gets even harder to fix because
now we have even more legacy software and hardware to worry about.

This really needs someone motivated enough to figure out what to do, but
that takes time and effort, at least the former of which is very much in
short supply. Either way, the best time to fix this was 10 years ago,
the second-best time is now :)

Cheers,
  Peter
