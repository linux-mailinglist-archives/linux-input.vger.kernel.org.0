This is certainly true for the newer xppen devices we are working on. 
However, while waiting for the xppen stuff to gain support, I bought a
tablet  that's already supported, the Gaomon S620. Executing libinput 
record or any other command that lists the devices, like evemu-describe, 
gives:

/dev/input/event15: GAOMON Gaomon Tablet
/dev/input/event16: GAOMON Gaomon Tablet Pad
/dev/input/event17: GAOMON Gaomon Tablet Touch Strip
/dev/input/event18: GAOMON Gaomon Tablet Dial

Can the contents maybe differ?

This is the ack the mini 7 gives me:
02 b1 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

While this is a button:
02 f0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

And here we have pen movement:
02 a1 59 23 ef 32 b8 0e 00 00 00 00
