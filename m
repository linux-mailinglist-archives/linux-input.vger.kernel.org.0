Hello, Jeff,

thank you very much for your feedback.

I agree that the voltage should not be hardcoded. I do not know what the
safe range for the touchscreen is though, because the downstream driver
does exactly this. I will try to test it with several values within the
range allowed by the regulator and see if I can determine some limits on
when the "ghost" touches do not appear.

However I am not sure whether this setting should be moved to the
regulator DT - it is my understanding that the DT for the regulator
should list the min/max range *supported* by the regulator, not conform
to requirements of its consumers, which should instead ask for the
regulator to be set to a range they require themselves, via their driver
- is it not so?

The regulator driver is not mainlined yet (although I managed to get the
downstream code working with mainline), however the downstream DT
contains much wider range of supported voltage (compared to those 3.1 V
used by the touchscreen) - an information which would get lost if I set
the DT for the regulator by the requirements of the touchscreen, which I
believe would have similiar implications as what you said regarding
using this regulator with other consumers.

What would seem a reasonable solution to me would be to move the voltage
range values to the touchscreen DT (which incidentally is what the
downstream driver does also, except it uses one value for both min and
max), so that they would be set by the driver but not hardcoded in the
code - what do you think about this?

Best regards,
K. B.
