Yes. See commit de0874165b83 ("drm/panel: Add a way for other devices
to follow panel state") where I point to Cong Yang's original patch
[1]. In that patch Cong was trying to make things work by assuming
probe ordering and manually taking some of the power sequencing stuff
out of some of the drivers in order to get things to work.

If the touchscreen and panel can be powered separately then, sure,
it's a policy decision.

In the cases where the touchscreen and panel need to be powered
together I'd say it's more than a policy decision. Even if it wasn't,
you have to make _some_ decision in the kernel. One could also argue
that if you say that you're going to force the panel to be powered on
whenever the touchscreen is on then that's just as much of a policy
decision, isn't it?

In any case, the fact that there is a shared power rail / shared power
sequence is because the hardware designer intended them to either be
both off or both on. Whenever I asked the EEs that designed these
boards about leaving the touchscreen on while turning the panel power
off they always looked at me incredulously and asked why I would ever
do that. Although we can work around the hardware by powering the
panel in order to allow the touchscreen to be on, it's just not the
intention.

Sure. I don't either though I'm hoping that we can come up with a more
complete solution long term.

It looks OK to me. The biggest objection I have is just that I dislike
it when code churns because two people disagree what the nicer style
is. It just makes for bigger diffs and more work to review things.

I'm not convinced that marking it as shared is any "less right" than
extra work to request the interrupt after we've probed the device.
Fundamentally both are taking into account that another touchscreen
might be trying to probe with the same interrupt line.
