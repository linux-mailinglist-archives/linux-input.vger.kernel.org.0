Yes, all this is true. I also see you re-wrote this part a bit in the 
series to add individual events for all the different line styles. I'll 
give this a shot and see how it works out. A problem I see is that we 
need to be able to program the pen line style also somehow, do we just 
set a single pen style to "enabled" and all the rest get set to 
"disabled" under the hood?

The fix in the BPF code is this (under process_tag()):

                         /*
                          * Force flags for line style. This makes it act
                          * as a simple variable from HID core point of 
view.
                          */
                         bpf_hid_set_data(ctx, (*idx + 1) << 3, 8, 0x2);

After that, the pen line style gets forwarded as a simple integer value 
to input-core / userspace also. raw events did not need modification 
after all, I just modified the report descriptor.

Attached a tarball with both descriptors and their corresponding IDs

Yes, it is kind of confusing, I was also trying to figure out the 
details with a remote proxy (someone telling me how things behave) until 
I decided to order a second chromebook that had the same controller. I 
can try to provide logs of the different cases if you want though. The 
quirks I know of at the moment:

1) controller does not immediately report "correct" values when pen 
touches screen (ELAN)

2) controller does never report "correct" values when pen touches screen 
(must do a force GET_REPORT) (GOODIX)

3) controller does not report "correct" values after SET_REPORT 
(reporting old value) (ELAN)

4) controller responds with bogus data in GET_REPORT (does not know the 
correct value yet) (ELAN + GOODIX)

I believe other vendors have different behavior with their controllers 
also, as the specs are not 100% clear on multiple things.

That sounds like something that would work yes, I did use workqueue 
before when this was a separate driver instead of a BPF program.

At least for USI purposes, ELAN+GOODIX controllers have pretty different 
quirks for them and it seems like having separate BPF programs might be 
better; trying to get the same BPF program to run for both sounds 
painful (it was rather painful to get this to work for single vendor.)

I could not find a way to initiate BPF call from userspace, thats the 
reason I implemented it this way. That said, I don't see any case where 
this would fail though; we only ever write the values from single source 
(userspace) and read them from kernel. If we miss a write, we just get 
the old value and report the change later on.

To initiate a BPF call from userspace we would need some sort of hid-bpf 
callback to a BPF program, which gets triggered by an ioctl or evdev 
write or something coming from userspace. Which brings us back to the 
chicken-egg problem we have with USI right now. :)
