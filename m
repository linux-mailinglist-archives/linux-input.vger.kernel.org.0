Agreed, I also think that adding the name to the vendor/product IDs
pair would be a better identifier. However, at this point, we don't 
have that information for all supported tablets, so I guess that we
will have to fix new tablets reusing the VIP:PID as they are
released.

It is unfortunate, but we'll have to deal with it.

Thanks a lot for your comments!
