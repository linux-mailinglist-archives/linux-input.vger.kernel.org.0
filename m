Sure. 
I actually had thought a bit about that and would say that the concept
of breathing, pulse etc.. can be modeled quite well with hardware patterns.

That's true. I would certainly hate that too.

I'd like to give it a shot and come up with a follow-up patch series
implementing e.g. breathing. Let's see how that turns out.
