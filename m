I've actually mentioned that in the cover letter and changelog of this
revision.  Couldn't do this previously because I submitted the HID series
before the USB audio one.

I think we should keep things simple for now, at least until we land the
basic support, also considering the USB part has been already merged.

Indeed, it's not possible to support hardware volume control from
ALSA/usb-audio without involving HID.  This could be done, or at least it's
worth investigating further, but it's not mandatory and definitely beyond
the scope of the current work.

There's a bit more complexity in here than initially anticipated, but the
(software) volume control is not really a problem.  It's worth noting I am
going to provide some UCM changes, part of the ALSA project:

  https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-ucm-conf

This is to ensure proper support for audio profile switching between
headphones/headset and internal speaker/microphone, which also addresses
a few volume control related issues.  Those are mainly caused by the haptic
feedback functionality, which is controlled by a pair of dedicated channels
in a quadraphonic audio stream.  One of the UCM's main jobs is to split the
4.0 PCM stream into 4 mono channels or a pair of stereo (FL+FR) channels,
depending on the active output device/profile.

The only blocker now is this HID series, which prevents us moving further.

Therefore, unless there is anything else remaining which requires urgent
attention, could you please provide an ack for Jiri to be able to pick this
up?

Thanks,
Cristian
