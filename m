No, my understanding is that Mark was OK with using KEY_VENDOR for Fn+N
combination that is supposed to start the utility that would collect
the debug info.

For double click there is still the discussion whether to have
KEY_DOUBLECLICK (which I think will need to be tied to the pointer
device somehow), or something else, like KEY_CONFIG or a new keycode if
we continue keeping it separate from the pointer operations and match
Windows behavior which invokes Lenovo configuration utility.

Thanks.
