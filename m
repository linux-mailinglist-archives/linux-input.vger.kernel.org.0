It doesn't seem to work reliably, for example I would often see this error:
[    2.234089] cyttsp5 2-0024: HID output cmd execution timed out
[    2.239957] cyttsp5 2-0024: Error on launch app r=3D-110
[    2.245150] cyttsp5 2-0024: Fail initial startup r=3D-110
[    2.257502] cyttsp5: probe of 2-0024 failed with error -110

Note that cyttsp5_hid_output_bl_launch_app is called immediately after
cyttsp5_deassert_int with the existing driver so presumably it doesn't actu=
ally
clear the interrupt line correctly.

Some more details:

Mostly startup issues with cyttsp5_deassert_read and retry logic from what =
I
can tell. It appears that in some cases(such as when the system is rebooted
without fully powering off) multiple i2c reads are often required to flush =
some
sort of firmware side message queue so that the firmware is in a state in w=
hich
it will respond to commands normally.

I don't understand the reason this driver was written using regmap in the f=
irst
place, from my understanding of the protocol using regmap is not appropriat=
e
as you can't correctly model an i2c-hid like protocol(like cyttsp5 uses) us=
ing
regmap.

Note that upstream drivers like i2c-hid don't use regmap either.

Ok, I'll see what I can do there.
