I just mean that defining a node name for 2 devices of the same class 
and at same address is separate problem from selecting which one to 
enable.

Yes, shrug...

Except for any other case where it's different addresses or different 
buses. Maybe different addresses could still use the same thing. I 
suppose the same class of device is unlikely to be on a different bus.

An extension to the unit-address would be the simpler solution, so we 
should explore that first I think.
