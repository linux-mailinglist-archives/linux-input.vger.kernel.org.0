short FYI, (I've Cc-ed you on the PR), but I just sent the PR for HID,
which includes this fix.

Maybe one suggestion that might help to reduce these kind of situations
in the future: can you configure your bot to notify the maintainers
after a couple of days that the patch has been merged that it would be
nice if they could send the PR to Linus?

In this case I bet Jiri forgot to send it because he was overloaded and
so was I. So a friendly reminder could make things go faster.

And maybe, before sending the reminder, if you could also check that the
target branch hasn't been touched in 2 days that would prevent annoyances
when we just added a commit and want to let it stay in for-next for 24h
before sending the full branch.

I would also say that this is wrong. Unless all regressions go through
your tree and you then send PR to Linus, you might quickly get
overloaded because sometimes the fix can not be cherry-picked if there
is one other change just before.

However, do you have some kind of dashboard that you could share with
the package maintainers? This way they could easily compare the not-yet
applied fixes with their bugs and decide to backport them themselves.

In other words: let others do the hard work, you are doing a lot already
:)

Anyway, I really think a friendly reminder would help makes things go
faster. Something like "Hey, it seems that you applied a regression fix
that I am currently tracking and that you haven't sent the PR to Linus
yet. Could you please send it ASAP as we already have several users
reporting the issue?".

Cheers,
Benjamin
