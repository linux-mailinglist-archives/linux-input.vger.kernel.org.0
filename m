You are right, I just tested for a while with the diff applied (without
reverting the commit causing the issue) and after putting the pen in
and out proximity a fair amount of times (> 100) it stopped working.

I added some logs with the hope that they help to understand the issue:

Once the stylus stops working, hidinput_hid_event() is called with a
usage->hid of HID_DG_TIPSWITCH.
Next, it gets called again with HID_DG_INRANGE. At this point
report->tool_active and report->tool evaluate to true, i.e.,
hid_report_set_tool() is not invoked.

This succession of HID_DG_TIPSWITCH + HID_DG_INRANGE is repeated while
the stylus is in range and the tool used is never reported to user
space. In other words, using "libinput record" I can see ABS_* events
but without a leading and trailing BTN_TOOL_PEN event.

Notice that when the stylus works, report->tool evaluates to false and
hid_report_set_tool(), which calls hid_report_release_tool(), is
invoked.

Let's wait for Benjamin's opinion. I don't think that reverting the
commit is the best option in this case. While checking Benjamin's
series I remembered this libinput MR:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/merge_requests/724

And I think they are related. Ideally we'd like to keep that fix.

Usually, these kind of patches get backported eventually. I'm afraid I
can not tell you if it'd be the case this time.

Jose
