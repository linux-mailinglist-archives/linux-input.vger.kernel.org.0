Hi Rain,

I think you might be confusing the device name string with the vendor
id, based on my interpretation of the output you shared.

  [    2.034760] input: SYNA7DB5:00 06CB:CD7E Mouse as /devices/platform/AM=
DI0010:00/i2c-0/i2c-SYNA7DB5:00/0018:06CB:CD7E.0001/input/input1
  [    2.034865] input: SYNA7DB5:00 06CB:CD7E Touchpad as /devices/platform=
/AMDI0010:00/i2c-0/i2c-SYNA7DB5:00/0018:06CB:CD7E.0001/input/input2

The first column has a device name but what we are interested in is the
second column, '06CB:CD7E'. 0x06CB is the vendor id and 0xCD7E is the
device id. Hope that makes sense and let me know if you think this is
off.

In general for these types of issues, I think the right direction would
be to make quirks loadable in userspace through HID-BPF where DEs or
some systemd subsystem can help users load quirks needed for their HID
devices rather than building a list of quirks in the driver. This is
something I am interested in exploring.

Thanks,

Rahul Rameshbabu
