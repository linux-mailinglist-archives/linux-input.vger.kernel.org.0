I'm sorry Benjamin: I did some research on how to build a kernel [1], on ho=
w to revert a commit (easy, I know a bit of Git), and started following it =
step by step. Result: I failed and concluded that it probably requires too =
much computer knowledge compared to what I can do now. I'm afraid I won't b=
e able to build a custom kernel for testing.
