I think you should pass NULL as the top half and make sure you have
IRQF_ONESHOT flag while requesting the interrupt. This way, the line
will be disabled by IRQ subsystem for the duration of the bottom half.

usleep_range(180, 200) before exitting the handler? You're in the bottom
half anyway.

IRQF_ONESHOT would probably help with this part, I guess. Could you give
it a shot?
