ftr though it's mostly obvious, this effectively moves all key
configuration into the kernel, doubly so for devices that are fully
programmable with no specific meanings (the XKeys devices are the oldest
ones that I'm aware of that don't work that way).

IOW, this approach works for semantic keys but not at all for anything
that's really just one key out of many with no real distinguishing
features otherwise.

OTOH it has saved us from having to ship keyboard models like XKB used
to do in userspace.

HID is currently unsuitable for two reasons: we don't have EVIOCREVOKE
for hidraw (I need to dust off that patch from years ago). And the
desktop input stack (i.e. libinput + compositors) doesn't handle that
use-case either, our key events are currently tied to EV_KEY codes. 
Can be worked around, just needs a fair bit of effort that without a
HIDIOCREVOKE (and logind integration) isn't worth starting.

But at least for these devices - libinput already doesn't handle
joysticks/gaming devices so I can easily ignore those too and let those
be punted to the application :) Which means the ioctl is all we need for
now?

The same problem rears its head in the EV_ABS and EV_REL range, so
fixing it for EV_KEY doesn't necessarily fix it for those.

MSC_PROG_KEY/VAL pairs would make it difficult to send two button
updates in the same frame without an SYN_MT_REPORT equivalent.

but (and this is not fully thought through) if we are ok with dropping
value 2 key repeat values we can make the input_event.value a bitmask,
so we can have EV_KEYMASK / KEYMASK_00, KEYMASK_32, .... so for buttons
1, 2 and 32 down you'd send
	EV_KEYMASK / KEYMASK_00 / 3
	EV_KEYMASK / KEYMASK_32 / 1
	SYN_REPORT

This should be nicely map-able from HID too. Would also work
for EV_MSC / MSC_PROG_KEYMASK if you don't want a new type.

Other random idea, even less thought out: have a marker bit/value that
designates anything in a certain range as "merely numbered'. Not sure
how to do that but that would make it possible for non-mt devices to
re-use the limited abs range for something else.

Cheers,
  Peter
