The original change introduced issues after boot and fixed issues after resume.

The new quirk fixes the issues after resume without introducing issues after boot.

The issues after boot where only affecting the NHxxRZQ and the N1xxCU iirc.

SERIO_QUIRK_NOMUX and SERIO_QUIRK_RESET_ALWAYS are required in the old fix for 
the resume issues to go away (I don't know if SERIO_QUIRK_NOLOOP and 
SERIO_QUIRK_NOPNP are required, I threw them in just in case because we were 
running them already on the device, so they where somewhat "field proven" to not 
break things).

However while SERIO_QUIRK_NOMUX and SERIO_QUIRK_RESET_ALWAYS for themself did 
not individually introduce the boot problem, in combination they did.

That was all I was able to find out back when I tested the old quirks.
