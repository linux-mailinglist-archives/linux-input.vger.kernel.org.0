Perhaps.

I'll admit, I'm not eager to go write the fd-passing solutions that
others are designing on the fly. I'm currently torn on whether I'll just
live with this current patch set out-of-tree (or, y'all can decide that
a simple, 99% working solution is better than no solution), because it's
simple; or possibly figuring out how to utilize such an ioctl cleanly
within our display manager. I'm not super hopeful on the latter.

IOW, I'm approximately in line with Doug's thoughts:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAD=FV=XARhZoj+0p-doxcbC=4K+NuMc=uR6wqG6kWk-MkPkNdQ@mail.gmail.com/
But then, we're obviously biased.

Well, we'd at least want something to advertise that the feature does
something ("is supported") I think, otherwise we're just asking user
space to do useless work.

Another commenter mentioned the latency tradeoff -- it's possible that
there are panels/eDP-links that resume fast enough that one doesn't care
to use this ioctl. For an in-kernel solution, one has all the data
available and could use hardware information to make decisions, if
needed. For a user space solution, we won't have any of that, and we'd
have to work to expose that information.

I suppose we could ignore that problem and only expose a minimal UAPI
until we need something more, but it feels like exposing a UAPI for
something is a critical point where one should make sure it's reasonably
descriptive and useful.

I'm not familiar with game-controlling accelerometers, but many types of
accelerometers are serviced by drivers/iio/.

And even if they register as input devices, do they match the ID list in
this patch?

They also won't match the input_handler ID list, because they won't
support the key or position combinations in the heuristic.

FWIW, the current work we have out-of-tree involves only select GPU
drivers that know they are slow to ramp up. If this were generalized,
then yes, it could potentially have undesireable side effects. I'm
certainly not an expert on Rob's work though, so I can't speak to this
very much, but I imagine we could resolve the {d,i}GPU problem easily.
