[CCing Richard, who apparently faces the same problem according to a
recent comment in the bugzilla ticket mentioned earlier:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219331#c8

CCing Mario, who might be interested in this and is a good contact when
it comes to issues with AMD stuff like this.

CCing the Btrfs list as JFYI, as all three reporters afaics see Btrfs
misbehavior or corruptions due to this.

Considered to bring Linus in, but decided to wait a bit before doing so.]

Skyler, Richard?

And sounds a lot like what Richard sees, who also sees disk corruption
with Btrfs (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2314331 ).

Skyler, did you see btrfs disk corruption as well, just like Chris and
Richard did?

From what I see it seems all three of you are using Fedora. Wonder if
that is a coincidence.

Given that Basavaraj Natikar never really addressed Chris earlier report
from months ago and the severeness of the problem I'd wonder if we
should revert the culprit to resolve this quickly, unless some proper
fix comes into sight soon. Sadly from a quick look that would require
multiple reverts afaics. :-/

Ciao, Thorsten
