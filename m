Ah, of course - that makes sense. For some reason, I had it in my head 
that it'd record the touchpad data directly - but that's a libinput 
tool. Seems obvious now, but I get you can't figure out the fake touches 
vs me mashing the touchpad :)

Ok, I'll take a peek at this. Just for my own workloads sake, I've 
installed the BPF hack first - just to make sure that it fixes the 
issue. I did have a thought that potentially its a hardware issue - but 
hopefully this issue is just the driver.

I'll give it a run for a little while to see if I get any of the same 
problems - and if not, try to figure out how to build a kernel with this 
patch.

To run a like for like comparison, I guess I'd want to take the Fedora 
SRPM, add the patch, rebuild that, and then run it to test. It's been a 
*long* time since I've done kernel builds :)

I know this isn't conducive to a quick test turnaround - but I'd rather 
give you correct feedback than quick feedback.
