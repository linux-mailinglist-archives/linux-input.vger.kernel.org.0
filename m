There are (unfortunately) a couple of Linux based OSes that don't use
systemd, which is one of the problems we see.

I think it might be a good idea to have a repository or directory
that's accessible to same contributions as the drivers, where this sort
of data is kept, as close to the drivers as possible.

You could always split off your quirks into separate "works with any
kernel" and "works from this version of the kernel" files, the goal
here would be to make sure that there is a canonical list of devices
that can be autosuspended, without user-space always playing catch-up
(especially as is the case now where systemd is being fed by ChromeOS
which is fed in some other way).

The Venn diagram of folks that contribute to hwdb quirks databases in
systemd and that contribute to kernel drivers has a pretty small
overlap. Moving much of those quirks to a kernel-controlled repository
(whatever format it ends up being in) would make sense so that the
"quirk enablement" and the "driver writing" sections overlap.
