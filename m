Perhaps then this should be solved in userspace where it can learn
which device is actually present and save that information for
subsequent boots.

I would guess most of the time that's pretty evident. They are going
to be on the same bus/link. If unrelated devices are on the same bus,
then that's going to get serialized anyways (if bus accesses are what
make things slow).

We could add information on the class of device. touchscreen and
touchpad aliases or something.

Why do you need the intermediate node other than a convenient way to
instantiate a driver? You just need a flag in each node which needs
this special handling. Again, "status" could work well here since it
keeps the normal probe from happening. But I'm not saying you can't
have some board specific code. Sometimes you just need code to deal
with this stuff. Don't try to parameterize everything to DT
properties.

Note that the above only works with "generic" compatibles with
"generic" power sequencing properties (I won't repeat my dislike
again). If only the driver knows how to handle the device, then you
still just have to have the driver probe. If you *only* wanted to
solve the above case, I'd just make "hid-over-i2c" take a 2nd (and
3rd) I2C address in reg and have those as fallbacks.

You could always make the driver probe smarter where if your supply
was already powered on, then don't delay. Then something else could
ensure that the supply is enabled. I'm not sure if regulators have the
same issue as clocks where the clock might be on from the bootloader,
then a failed probe which gets then puts the clock turns it off.
