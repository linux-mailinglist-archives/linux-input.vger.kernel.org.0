Hi José,

First of all, thanks a lot for all the work you're doing with the tablets!

Yes, this situation is unfortunate, but there's really not much we could do.
The tablet database at http://digimend.github.io/tablets/ hasn't been updated 
in ages, and it has never been exhaustive to start with.

There are tons of tablet modifications, including of the same (marketed) 
model, and those can differ not only in the reported name, but probably even 
the VID:PID, as could've happened when Huion switched from v1 to v2 protocol.

So, I think a "whitelist" would be a maintenance nightmare.

Moreover, I think it's better to disable the tablet completely in case we 
failed initialization (e.g. got an invalid response to configuration, or 
failed to find some interfaces and such), after producing a comprehensive 
error message. Configuring a tablet partially, and then handing it over to the 
generic driver could mess things up more.

It's less confusing for the user, and stops them from trying to fix the 
problem up the stack with various settings, often getting into a worse 
situation. It's also much easier for the maintainer, since they don't need to 
investigate all the higher layers.

A "blacklist" would work better here, if you can find the tablets to include.

Nick
