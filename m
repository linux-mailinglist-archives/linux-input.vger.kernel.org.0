Interesting way to just get a unique identifier. But it could be any
phandle not used by another group. So just point all the devices in a
group to one of the devices in the group.

This seems like overkill to me. Do we really need groups and a mutex
for each group? Worst case is what? 2-3 groups of 2-3 devices?
Instead, what about extending "status" with another value
("fail-needs-probe"? (fail-xxx is a documented value)). Currently, the
kernel would just ignore nodes with that status. Then we can process
those nodes separately 1-by-1. You may just have to change "status"
via a changeset as there's already some support in some buses (I2C,
SPI IIRC) for new devices showing up with overlays. I'm not really a
fan of adding the probe mutex and would prefer if we can serialize
this with just controlling "status". The challenge at that level is
knowing if/when you have probed especially if we have to wait on
modules to load. But if we must serialize with a mutex, with 1 group
it could be a global mutex and a 1 bit flag in struct device instead.
