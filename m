I've checked a whole bunch of DSDTs from standard x86 ACPI laptops and
it seems the _PRW is only used when devices use a GPE for wakeup; not when
they are using a standard GPIO-irq as wakeup source.

To be specific _PRW seems to only be present on PCI devices and on the
ACPI pwr-button and ACPI lid switch devices.

I2C attached touchpads and touchscreens seem to never have _PRW set
(at least in the collection of DSDTs which I have).

Note that what you are doing here is in essence completely reverting
commit 203c38fbe833 ("HID: i2c-hid: Enable wakeup capability from Suspend-to-Idle")
(note when I reviewed that I deliberately asked for the wakeup to be
disabled by default to avoid regressions).

Going ahead with this change would in essence cause regressions,
breaking wakeup by touchpad on many many laptops, so NACK.

I'm in 2 minds about this. To me this feels like the story where a person goes
to the doctor and says "doctor if I do this-thing it hurts". To which the doctor
replies: "Well then don't do this-thing". IOW if ChromeOS would not write the
wakeup sysfs attribute then there would be no problem

If I've understood the problem correctly then the issue is with a touchscreen
right? Unlike the I2C-HID driver which does not know the difference between
a touchpad, touchscreen or say a sensor-hub. Userspace can easily query the
associated input evdev node and NOT enable wakeup on touchscreens (which seems
to be a weird thing to do regardless of if it works properly or not).
Blindly enabling wakeup on all devices seems like it is a recipe for hitting
all sort of interesting bugs; and it seems best to just avoid that in
the first place.

As I said I'm in 2 minds about this, OTOH this does feel like a hardware
bug why does the interrupt trigger when the touchscreen is put into S3 ?

To me this feels as if the interrupt line is missing a pull-up/-down or
has the wrong pull-up/-down setting requiring it to be actively driven
to the not-irq state and sending an irq signal as soon as the line is
not actively driven. Could this be a problem with the configuration of
the built-in pull-up/-downs of the GPIO pin used for the IRQ
(which can be controlled by the firmware) ?

you are right that the kernel should not export a non working wakeup sysfs
attribute, so if this cannot be fixed in firmware, then the best option is
probably to add a quirk for this model to the existing quirk list in the
I2C-HID code and to not do the device_set_wakeup_capable() call on this
specific touchscreen based on a new quirk.

Calling enable_irq_wake() is necessary for wakeup to work on devices which
use a normal GPIO IRQ rather then a GPE for wakeup.

The only case where the enable_irq_wake() should probably not be done is when
their is an ACPI_COMPANION and that ACPI companion has a valid _PRW, which
as mentioned above most (all?) I2C-HID ACPI device nodes do _not_ have.

Hans
