Dear Friend,

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise. I am a legal
practitioner at law to a deceased Immigrant property Magnate. I hoped
that you will not expose or betray this trust and confidence that I am
about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our both
families.

We need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of
US$11.5million immediately to your account. The money has been dormant
for years in our bank here without anybody coming for it. We want to
release the money to you as the nearest person to our deceased
customer (the owner of the account) who died along with his supposed
next of kin in a car crash since.

We don't want the money to go into our Bank treasury as an abandoned
fund. So this is the reason why I contacted you so that we can
release the money to you as the nearest person to the deceased
customer. please we would like you to keep this proposal as a top
secret and delete if you are not interested.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send you full details on how the
a business will be executed and also note that you will have 50% of the
above mentioned sum if you agree to transact the business with us.

FULL NAMES/ADDRESS.....................
AGE AND SEX.................
COUNTRY........................
PHONE NUMBER...................
PROFESSION........................
EMAIL...............................

I await your urgent response as soon as possible. urgently to
nickafaomau@gmail.com for more details

Best regards,
Barr.Nick Afaomau Esq
