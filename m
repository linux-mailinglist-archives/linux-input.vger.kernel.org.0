foo_initcall()
{
  if (of_machine_is_compatible(...))
    platform_device_create();
}

That chunk would have to be built in and if that's part of the driver
module, autoloading wouldn't work.

We could have a match table of board compatibles and driver names. I'm
not worried about that list being big, so I'm happy to stick that in
drivers/of/.

That was my thought. There is the case of the devices are almost the
same, so we lie. That's what you are doing for displays IIRC.

That's really just making the mutex node link the other direction. The
devices link to the common mutex node vs. the hwmanager node(s) links
to all the devices. That's really just picking the paint colors.

BTW, there was an idea long ago from maintainer emeritus Likely to
append overlays to the base DTB for the kernel to apply.

How would that help you here? Are you going to have an overlay for
each device that enables it? It's much easier to just call
of_update_property() to change "status".
