So, here's an update on this situation. I managed to hack around
this situation by writing a simple kernel module to override the button
mapping for this device. The code for the module can be found on my
GitHub here:
https://gist.github.com/camthesaxman/af7099505103a555518741b4083eaea8
I have almost zero experience with kernel development, so I don't know
how this kind of thing would be properly fixed in-tree (perhaps
something with hid-quirks.c?) and make a proper patch for the kernel.

Thanks,
Cameron
