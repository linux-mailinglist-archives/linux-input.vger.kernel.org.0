Ok, thanks for the pointer.

I get your point, but with runtime pm suspending the touchpad after a
timeout it seems that would still be the most flexible alternative
which allows deferring the decision whether to support wakeup on
touch events to the user.

I hear you, but users sometimes want do things with their hardware which
may not have originally been intended (e.g. your kiosk example).

Ok, but this isn't just about style as that initial_power_on() function
which does all the magic needs to be broken up to fix the regression
(unless you want to convolute the driver and defer resource lookups
until panel power-on).

I'll respin a v2 with that panel-property lookup change I mentioned and
hopefully we can get this fixed this week.

If you need to start to thinking about rewriting your interrupt handler,
I'd say that qualifies as "less right". ;)
