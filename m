Yeah, there were a few items missing from a "blank" qemu:
- loading the SSDT overlay in the initramfs so it's seen before anything
  else
- actually define the description of the device in the DSDT at the
  matching PCI bus address
- your patch :)

I don't think this is the issue. When the device is initially probed,
the I2C acpi implementation tries to attach an IRQ, but failed at it,
returning -EPROBE_DEFER, which makes the device being retried a few
times.

After I get my shell available I even get the pr_err I included few
seconds later, for a last attempt by the kernel to bind it when
everything has settled.

So I can see that the device gets probed, and that all ACPI resources
are tried to get the IRQ.
Right now, I see that it's attempting to bind to the acpi resource in 
acpi_dev_resource_interrupt() (in file drivers/acpi/resources.c), but
instead of having a ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_EXTENDED_IRQ I only get a
ACPI_RESOURCE_TYPE_GPIO for the GpioInt() definition in the _CRS method.

So I am missing the proper transition from GpioInt to IRQ in the acpi.

Note that I tried applying what was describe at
Documentation/firmware_guide/acpi/gpio-properties.rst but the _DSD
method doesn't seem to be properly applied to the CP2112 GPIO, which is
highly suspicious.

As I mentioned above I don't think the issue is in the ordering of the
I2C vs gpio resources.

I don't know. Though the _DSD documentation I mentioned above looks very
similar to what you are describing in the DT case, so maybe the ACPI
folks will just tell us "why don't you use XXXX?" and we will have the
solution :) (we can't be the first to have that same issue TBH)
