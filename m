Looking at the logs you provided, and when you switch pens, it seems
the serial number in the Elan case is updated while hovering (but it
takes 3 seconds to get to that point).
Also, the first time you hovered the pen, the inrange slot was not
long enough to be 3 seconds, so maybe that's the time the controller
needs to manually update the information.

OTOH, on the Goodix one, if you initiated the GET_REPORT after the
first touch, the information came in a few ms.

So I wonder, what if you take the BPF program from the goodix and
start querying the information as soon as the pen is hovering in the
Elan case. Would that accelerate the time it fetches them?

And of course, Goodix doesn't even bother with the serial number.

Ouch. Well, that also means that this is used as an index and if the
controller were to support more than a pen, the index would be 2 for
the second pen when the first is touching...
So this is not reliable for now, but is consistent with a multi-pen scenario.

Well, that also means that we can ignore this field until we see
controllers capable of handling more than one pen.

That is worrying. The serial number is also cached and we don't know
if we are using the same pen or not way too long after the pen touched
the surface.

The 0x77 doesn't bother me too much. This should not trigger an input
event because we are out of the usage range.

I might be wrong, but I am not sure if soft IRQs are incompatible with
hid_hw_raw_request.
Anyway, I gave it a shot today and I am hitting the fact that we lose
the BPF context in the timer callback. So we might actually need a new
API :/

Yeah, sorry for the delay.

Oh. Glad to see that this is something you find interesting. Peter
Hutterer mentioned that idea and I am still not 100% sure about it,
but if you also think it'll make things easier, then why not :)
