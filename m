The race is normally because the device is announced to userspace before
the attributes are added.  But you are right, the race is still the same
here, the attributes are added after probe succeeds, so it's the same
time, so this changelog text is wrong, sorry about that.

I'll rewrite this to just say it's cleaner and simpler with this change
and resend it in a few days.
