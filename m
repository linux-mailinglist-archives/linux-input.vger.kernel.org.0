The right place to look into appears to be Documentation/kernel-hacking/locking.rst

I see mutex being used in various irq handlers, even bmi323-imu but that page has
many alternatives for irq.

There is rwlock_t but it appears to be using spinlock on certain configurations.

Absolute worst-case scenario you might resort implementing an rwlock with mutexes only.

I would avoid taking decisions based solely on the configuration because ASUS
makes keyboards and reuses designs across various products, so it is very likely
at least one model of those keyboards can be confused with a laptop one.

Beside I am sure there must be at the very least one appropriate synchronization primitive,
so I would discard the configure option.
