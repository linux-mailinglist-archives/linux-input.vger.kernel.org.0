To close out this thread, the issue was due to a UAF bug in driver
core that was fixed by:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220513112444.45112-1-schspa@gmail.com/

With that fix, there wouldn't have been a crash, but amba driver
registration would have failed (because match returned
non-EPROBE_DEFER error).
