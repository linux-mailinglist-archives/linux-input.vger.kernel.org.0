Assuming that the parts are on the exact same bus is ok, there has to be a
flexibility limit, or this framework will definitely get abused in the wrong
ways.

This is exactly why I think that this should allow a certain kind of "modularity",
meaning that subsystems should be able to register their own hook into this: in
both cases of ADC and/or DSI readback we're getting into some fairly (less, or
more) complicated territory - and it's something that people around each subsystem
knows best - and they must have that kind of flexibility and freedom to change the
hooked implementation in their own subsystem instead of somewhere else.

There would be much more to say about this, but I'm avoiding to write a wall of
text because I'm sure that you can read through the lines and can get my point
anyway.

That would as well work - and would be way better than early init. Reading it back
now, putting that in a early init function would be counter-productive in general.
