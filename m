Okay.  But in any case, you're doing this in the wrong place.  Remote 
wakeup capability depends on the configuration, so you must not enable 
in usb_new_device() before the configuration has been chosen.

Furthermore, remote wakeup gets turned on only at the time when the 
device is suspended.  We don't leave it on all the time.

Not all laptops have ACPI.

The decision about whether or not to enable remote wakeup for a USB 
device is a matter of policy.  It has to be decided by the user, not by 
the kernel.

This is why there are userspace tools, like Powertop, that 
automatically enable remote wakeup when devices are detected and that 
allow the user to control which devices get enabled.  Using these tools 
is easy and convenient -- that's why they exist -- so the kernel's 
interface does not need to be friendly.
