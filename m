I'm a bit reluctant to make significant changes to how the
hid-logitech-dj driver works. We have seen a number of regressions
when it was changed to handle the non unifying receivers and I would
like to avoid more regressions.

Some questions:
1. What is the specific use case where you are hitting this?
2. Can't the userspace tools involved by modified to handle the errors
they are getting gracefully?
3. Is there a bugreport open about this somewhere?

I don't believe that this is the reason, we only create hid child
devices for devices reported by the receiver, but some of the non
unifying hid receiver send a list of all devices paired, rather
then the ones which are actually connected at that time.

The suggested approach sounds fragile and like it adds complexity to
an already not simple driver.

It would be helpful to first describe the actual problem you are trying
to fix (rather then suggesting a solution without clearly defining the
problem) and then we can see from there.

Hans
