Current driver patch uses a prefix name "himax_i2chid" which comes
from the previous project
 and seems not suitable for this condition, so I use "xxx" and plan to
replace it in the next version.
For finding firmware, I think both solutions are reasonable.
- provide firmware name directly: implies no-flash and use user
specified firmware, no PID info.
- provide no-flash-flag and PID info: loading firmware from organized
names with PID info.
I prefer the 2nd solution, but it needs more properties in dts. 1st
has less properties and more
intuitive.

I don't know which one is more acceptable by the community, as you
know I'm a newbie here.

Thanks,
Tylor
