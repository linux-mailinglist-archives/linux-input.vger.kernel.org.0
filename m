Good day dear,
 I am Mr. John Hartwell, the Chief Operating Officer(COF) of
Operations unit of our bank here in Burkina-Faso.

 Its obvious that we did not know each other in person but I have no
option than to contact you due to the nature of the deal that prompted
me to do so. I have a risk-free deal to share with you. While I was
accessing the account files of our foreign customers for annual audit,

 I discovered a dormant account with unclaimed of us$14.4 million over
a decade now. I can=E2=80=99t declare the account or submit my report to th=
e
bank because there is no one living to claim the sum. My further
research into the account indicated that the beneficiary of the
account died with his entire family in a bomb expolision during his
visit in his home town.

 Now I am contacting you so that my bank will transfer the money to
your account as the only existing next of kin to the deceased. Our
banking law stipulated that so far as you are a foreigner, you are
eligible to claim the funds. So kindly and urgently reply with your
full details so that I will guide you on what next to do.Please
assure me honestly that you will keep this deal confidential without
betraying me after you have received the funds in your account.

 I wait for your urgent reply.
Regards,
johnhartwell414@gmail.com
Mr. John Hartwell
