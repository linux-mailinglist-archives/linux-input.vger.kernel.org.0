Yep.

That's right.

Here is what /sys/kernel/debug/gpio has for the bad case (no patches):

  gpio     int|active|trigger|S0i3| S3|S4/S5| Z|wake|pull|  orient| 
  debounce|reg
#0        😛|     b|   edge|    |   |     |⏰|    |  ↑ |input  ↑|b (🕑 
046875us)|0x8151ce3

And then for the good case (these two patches):

  gpio     int|active|trigger|S0i3| S3|S4/S5| Z|wake|pull|  orient| 
  debounce|reg
#0        😛|     b|   edge|    |   |     |⏰|    |  ↑ |input  ↑| 
       |0x8151c00

That sounds a like a generally good direction to me.

I think I would still like to see the ASL values translated into the 
hardware even if the ASL has a "0" value.
So I would keep patch 1 but adjust for the warning you guys both called out.

As you have this hardware would you be able to work out that quirk?

Or if you want me to do it, I'll need something to go on how to how to 
effectively detect BYT and CYT hardware.

Yeah that sounds like a plausible hypothesis.
