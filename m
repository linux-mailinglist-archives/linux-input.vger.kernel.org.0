No, I left out the prefix on purpose as I mentioned in the cover letter.
There is nothing vendor specific about this property and I expect it to
be reused for other devices.

And "keep-power-in-suspend" is too specific and indeed looks like
instruction to the OS rather than hw description (more below), but
importantly it is not related to the problem here (which is about
reset, not power).

Right, and this was why I at first rejected a property name like this in
favour of 'reset-pulled-to-supply' in my first draft. That name
obviously does not work as the 'supply' suffix is already claimed, but I
also realised that it doesn't really describe the hardware property that
allows the reset line to remain asserted.

The key feature in this hardware design is that the reset line will not
just be pulled to the supply voltage (what other voltage would it be
pulled to), but that it is also pulled to ground when the supply is
disabled.

Rather than trying to encode this in the property name, I settled on the
descriptive 'no-reset-on-power-off' after the seeing the prior art in
'goodix,no-reset-during-suspend' property. The latter is too specific
and encodes policy, but the former could still be considered hardware
description and would also apply to other designs which have the
property that the reset line should be left deasserted.

One such example is when the supply can not be disabled at all (e.g. the
Goodix case), but I can imagine there being more than one way to design
such reset circuits.

The power supply is shared with other peripherals and the hardware
designers have made provisions so that the reset line can remain
deasserted regardless of the state of the supply in order to save power.
