Well, sort of. The USB spec merely states how to enter and exit
a suspended state and that device state must not be lost.
It does not tell you what a suspended device must be able to do.

That is a decision a distro certainly can make. However, the kernel
does not, by default, call usb_enable_autosuspend() for HID devices
for this very reason. It is enabled by default only for hubs,
BT dongles and UVC cameras (and some minor devices)

In other words, if on your system it is on, you need to look
at udev, not the kernel.

Well, no. Runtime PM is a trade off. You lose something if you use
it. If it worked just as well as full power, you would never use
full power, would you?

Whether the loss of functionality or performance is worth the energy
savings is a policy decision. Hence it belongs into udev.
Ideally the kernel would tell user space what will work in a
suspended state. Unfortunately HID does not provide support for that.

This is a deficiency of user space. The kernel has an ioctl()
to let user space tell it, whether a device is fully needed.
X does not use them.

Well, I am afraid your patch breaks it and if you do not break
it, the patch is reduced to nothing.

You switch it on from user space. Of course the kernel default
must be safe, as you said. It already is.
