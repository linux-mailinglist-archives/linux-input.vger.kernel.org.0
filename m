Andrii,

I made a low-effort attempt to switch away from tools/include and it
looks like too much trouble. See a sample splat below.

I think the issue is that resolve_btfids uses a couple of inherently
user-space things (stdlib, libelf), which themselves may include
system headers. And there is actually a difference between the kernel
and tools/include headers. For example, check

  ./include/linux/rbtree.h
vs
  ./tools/include/linux/rbtree.h

Maybe we can make it work (with our own local tools/include?), but it
doesn't look worth it for just a couple of constant #define-s.

Let me know if I am missing something.
