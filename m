Generally speaking, when your commit message has an "also" in the
middle, it means that the next feature(s) need to be split in their own
patches.

So this means that this patch should at least be split in 4.

This is the wrong reason to split a patch series. Well, it's true, it's
too big, but you have to take into account the reviewers/maintainers
point of view:
- we don't know the internals of your device
- we don't (necessarily) have access to the docs
- we don't have a lot of time to spend on a review
- we can not focus on a 9000 lines of code patch and remember every
  single aspect when reviewing, to be able to point bugs

Given that you compared this driver to i2c-hid, please have a look at
the history of it:
- my first initial submission[0] (v1) was a single patch of 1000 loc,
  but it contained only the core functionality to bind a driver. I
  stripped everything else that could make it useful (ACPI or DT
  bindings) but it was a an attempt at being a one-to-one mapping of the
  I2C part of the publicly available specification
- shortly after I sent a separate 14 patches series to do more cleanups
  on the initial patch, as things were moving forward
- then Mika submitted the ACPI handling[1]
- and DT bindings came later [2] (8 months after the initial submission)

My point is, when the code is that big, it's perfectly fine to have it
split and maybe not have all of the functionalities available in the
first submission.

Bonus point for not having everything and in smaller patches: it's less
of a pain to change or drop stuff :)

hx-hid is a terrible name. Why not at least "himax-hid"? Or maybe
"himax-spi-hid"?

Also, I can't remember if this was already asked, but is that driver
vaguely related to the HID over SPI specification from Microsoft?

We have seen one submission in the past regarding that even if it didn't
went through, but if your driver implements this protocol following
Microsoft's specification, I'd rather not have a custom vendor code when
we can have a "standardized" one.

[...]

Cheers,
Benjamin
