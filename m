Hi Lucas,

(TBH, that cover letter screams AI :-P)

Stating a "long-standing architectural limitation" is a bit rough. The
need wasn't there or nobody took the time and effort to plug this hole
:)

General comment on this cover letter actually: it is way too detailed,
and try to iron out every corner case the AI bot thought would be fought
against.
Which leads to people actually nitpicking on the details below:
for example, I immediately thought the Wacom bit down below was wrong.

But really, all you need is multiple battery support on devices.
And this is fine. A couple of example would be good enough, and we can
move on.

Technically, most Wacom styluses are battery-less for their pencils. The
battery issue that was related below is for a AES device, which is an
integrated wacom tablet in a laptop, so the only battery we have is on
the stylus itself. Arguably we can have several styluses, but only one
can be used at the same time, so reusing the same power supply device is
fine.

(see, I told you, that's the "someone is wrong on the internet effect")

That's an entire different reason why there is HID++, and the fact that
Solaar handles batteries itself is lack of support in the kernel for
some devices. (and because sometimes it's much simpler to update a user
space client than a kernel driver)

I don't think Linux ever forced any manufacturer to use proprietary
protocols or vendor-specific software. For Logitech (or any gaming mouse
FWIW), those protocols were in place well before Linux ever had support
for them.

This is completely BS and AI generated. There is no such cycle.

But again, the need is there, so we need to push this series forward.
The packaging of the cover letter is wrong. We are not salesmen, there
is no need to pitch this like that.

That paragraph is good. Keep it please :)

Same, please keep that testing note in future versions.

The sad part is that HID can report a lot of things, but manufacturers
don't make a full use of it.

For example, in the split keyboard case, you could make use of the
Handedness NAry of the generic device Controls page (0x06) which can
help describing Left Hand (0x32) and Right Hand (0x33).

But the problem is more likely that no known manufacturer will follow
your lead on this, and the NAry code you put here will only be used by
your firmware.

For the bluetooth earbuds, the Logical collection Channel Left (0x161,
page Consumer Page 0x0c) and Channel Right (0x162, same page) could be
used.

List based storage should be fine. We don't receive battery updates that
often, so if that is simpler for you, that's all right.

> Should we support usage-based identification in addition to report ID for
> devices using the same report ID?

If the question is:
- should we enforce each battery to have a different name, the answer is
	yes
- should we take the report ID as the battery identifier in the name:
	why not?
- should we make use of other collections to split up batteries: maybe.
	If you have a device which reports multiple batteries on the same
	report ID, then yes, we will need a way to split them.

But again, we are only theorically speaking here, so it's hard to
answer. I really wish we had an actual consumer device we could use as a
reference, not a custom firmware we can tune in any way we want.

Semantic would be ideal, but at least having a unique identifier is a
requirement. That's more a question for the upower guys.

hid-input.c seems fine to me. There are technically not a lot of
differences from the existing AFAICT, it's just that we iterate over a
list.

I'm not sure I follow that backwards compatibility. AFAIU that API is
kernel internal, so it should be easier to drop it entirely instead of
duplicating the data for no benefit.

Not a power supply maintainer, but unless upower builds a graph of the
devices it sees, I don't see why this would be a problem.

And now after all of this bikeshedding, I can move on to the review of
