Yeah, I'd agree here too. I've never found evidence that it was actually
needed and it really looks like cargo cult to me.

And if it was needed, then I'm not sure we need refcounting either. We
don't have refcounting for atomic_enable / disable, we have a sound API
design that makes sure we don't fall into that trap :)

I'm ok with this, if we follow-up in a couple of releases and remove it
and all the calls.

Could you add a TODO item so that we can keep a track of it? A follow-up
is fine if you don't send a new version of that series.
