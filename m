Well that would explain the difference, and git blame gives the history [1].

It's from enablement for Android with ACPI power button.  That commit 
also mentions that Android can handle both POWER and WAKEUP from input 
device to wakeup the system.  Non-Android userspace doesn't do anything 
with KEY_WAKEUP today.

So this has me thinking the proposal I had above to special case 
KEY_POWER and translate to KEY_WAKEUP is the right way forward, just 
making sure to release the key as you rightfully pointed out.
