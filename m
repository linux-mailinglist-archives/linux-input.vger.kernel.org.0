Exactly.

These are really 2 different events and the problem
is that atm the kernel reports this as one and
the same event type. It really is as simple as this.

Note that I'm not proposing on making this change
something which all gpio_keys drivers will get
automatically.

My idea of adding a wakeup_code field to
struct gpio_keys_button allows individual gpio_keys
users to opt-in to the behavior of
sending KEY_SOMETHINGELSE on wakeup-by-gpio-button-press.

Since soc_button_array is only used on x86/ACPI platforms
and since by far the most x86/ACPI platforms use
the ACPI button code for the power-button, which already
behaves this way I do not expect any userspace problems
from doing such a change in soc_button_array because
if that were a problem then we would already have bug
reports because of the ACPI button code's behavior.

If users do a long power-button press on x86 they are
*always* trying to do a forced power-off and after 4s
(or longer in some special cases) the hw itself will
do such a forced poweroff. So I do not believe that
we need to worry about long presses since those
have a very specific meaning on x86/ACPI platforms.

Also if there is a long press userspace will simply
see KEY_WAKEUP never getting released, which is
actually an accurate representation of things,
the user woke up the system through the power-button
and never released ir.

Regards,

Hans
