Useless event nodes should not be created. At the moment, the driver
disables all interfaces that are not used and, after switching to "raw"
mode, it should only create a node for each valid device.

At the moment, there are only HID descriptors for the frame and the pen
so, if your tablet is creating a touch ring device, something is not
working as expected.

Running "sudo libinput record" should display only the frame and the
pen. Does it show something different in your case?

	$ sudo libinput record

My tablets also send an ACK packet, but in my case it does not have any
visible effects. Maybe it is related to the DE environment used. I
tested it on elementary OS (Ubuntu) and Fedora 36, in both cases the
ACK is ignored... But catching it is fine, we can include the code you
suggest.

In the devices I tested, the ACK packet is always present, so it should
be fine to catch it. I'll test your patch in all the devices I own to
be safe.

Best wishes,
Jose
