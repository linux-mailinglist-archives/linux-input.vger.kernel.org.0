Hi,

It does indeed not work under Windows either. In addition, the Toshiba ACPI
implementation is incomplete: the "required" _PRW method is missing. And
only about half of what would be needed to handle the wakeup button
identification is actually present in the DSDT as far as I can tell.

Furthermore, given what Toshiba uses the buttons for, waking from sleep
with them make little sense. One button is to toggle the touchpad on/off,
one is to select external display mode (mirrored, extended, ...) and one
is to toggle between normal and low power "eco mode" (it basically dims the
screen and limits the CPU speed under Windows).

I believe Toshiba for whatever reason simply decided to piggy back on this
standard for some strange reason for their buttons. This is odd as
toshiba_acpi already implements Fn key handling (which this laptop also
has). Who knows why they couldn't just hook up the physical buttons as
special keys. Because that is the only thing that sets these apart
physically: They are buttons, not keys.

Best regards,
Arvid Norlander
