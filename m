Do you have the brand/catalogue name for the device on which you tested
this? I found a "YCCTEAM" joypad, but it seems that the audio interface
is supposed to work (maybe that's only on wireless?).

Do you think you could also look into a patch for BlueZ's cable pairing
plugin? It uses 0x81 too, even though it does have some fallback code.
