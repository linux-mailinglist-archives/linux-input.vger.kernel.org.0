Hmm, that's not my experience. Specifically I've seen i2c-hid devices
whose datasheets say that you're not allowed to talk i2c to them at
all for hundreds of milliseconds after you power them on. See, for
instance, "i2c-hid-of-goodix.c" which has a "post_gpio_reset_delay_ms"
of 180 ms and "i2c-hid-of-elan.c" which has one of 300 ms.

As I understand it these touchscreens have firmware on them and that
firmware can take a while to boot. Until the firmware boots they won't
respond over i2c. This is simply not something that Linux can do
anything about.

About the best you could do would be to add a board-specific driver
that understood that it could power up the rails, wait the maximum
amount of time that all possible touchscreens might need, and then
look for i2c ACKs. I'm still hoping to hear from Rob about how I would
get a board-specific driver to load on a DT system so I can
investigate / prototype this.

No matter what we need to add something to the dts each time a second
source is added, right?

While it's true that we'd end up with some extra drivers, if we do it
correctly we don't necessarily need a driver for each group of devices
nor even a driver per board. If several boards have very similar
probing requirements then, even if they have unique "compatible"
strings they could still end up using the same Linux driver.

I've actually been talking offline with folks on ChromeOS more about
this problem as well. Chen-Yu actually pointed at a patch series (that
never landed, I guess) that has some similar ideas [1]. I guess in
that case Hans was actually constructing device tree properties
manually in the driver. I was thinking more of having all of the
options listed in the device tree and then doing something that only
causes some of them to probe.

If Rob was OK with it, I guess I could have some sort of top-level
"hwmanager" node like Hans did and then have phandle links to all the
hardware that are managed by it. Then I could just change those to
"okay"?

Ideally, though, this could somehow use device tree "overlays" I
guess. That seems like almost a perfect fit. I guess the issue here,
though, is that I'd want the overlays bundled together with the
original DT and then the board-specific "hardware prober" driver to
actually apply the overlays after probing. Does that seem sensible?
