Yeah, I have not received your first series, only knew of it when the 
replies came. It's fine though :)

If you don't mind the extra hassle, I'm all in for my generalization 
thing going together with your series.

Alternatively, I can resend it myself, but I believe it would be better 
if they go in bulk since they need to be applied together.

Actually, the regulator values belong to the device-tree, because the 
device-tree for the board is what describes the board's regulators, and 
since you know what components are installed on that specific board you 
can know which regulator values are supposed to be set for it. This 
manual voltage setting can cause conflicts with other drivers for 
example. Also some device can use a variable wide voltage range, and 
some only specific narrow one, and e.g. the driver with wide range would 
set it to voltage that isn't suitable for the narrow range device, so 
it's much better to just specify it manually than have it resolved.

The actual min/max values for regulators or its voltage table is 
provided by the regulator driver itself, so there's not much point in 
specifying those again in the device-tree.
