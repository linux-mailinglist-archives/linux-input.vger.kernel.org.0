That's correct and that's a good way to phrase it.
I will add that in the commit message.

I would prefer to have the driver's matrix_keypad (build in probe()) to
match the actual hardware. To me this seems easier to understand for
people familiar with the hardware.

I've also tested the above snippet and it matches my expectations.

Indeed. I plan to send out double keypad support for this driver since
that's actually needed for mt8183-pumpkin as well.
It's already in our mtk-v5.10[1] integration tree but I have not submitted
it yet.
I planned to send this a separate series to avoid burdening / have
smaller chunks to review. If that was a mistake, please let me know.

> but I do not actually see this map layout that Mattijs drew  documented

The map layout that I draw is not directly copied from the datasheet.
It's a "translation" of the following table:

| hardware key code | col0 | col1 | col2|
| ----------------- | -----| ---- | --- |
| row0              | 0    | 1    | 2   |
| row1              | 9    | 10   | 11  |
| row2              | 18   | 19   | 20  |

It seems that caused more confusion than actual useful information,
sorry about that.

The concern for "DTSes in the wild" that will break is a valid point.
I'm not aware of any of those. Most vendor trees i've seen don't use
this driver at all. I hope that will change at some point.

In the end. I'd prefer to have the driver's keypad matrix match
the actual hardware. Right now we can have a 5x32 matrix which seems
absurd. Having at most an 8x8 is more reasonable.

I'd like to send v3 with just fixing the row/column suggestion in
mt6779_keypad_irq_handler() that Dmitry suggested.

Would that work Dmitry?
