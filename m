And what is the plan on dealing with all other drivers that emit
KEY_POWER? What about acpi button behavior when using S0ix? What about
holding power button for too long so that normal reporting "catches" the
pressed state?

Kernel reports hardware events, interpreting them and applying certain
policies is task for userspace.

Thanks.
