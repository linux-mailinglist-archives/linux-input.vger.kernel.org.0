Hello, Markuss,

thank you for your response and please forgive that my original emails
didn't reach you - I am trying to see if I can get the SMTP server I use
for my primary address officially authorized to send emails in its name
so that Google does not reject them.

I will be sure to drop the renaming for v2.

I have come across your patch series and in fact my original experiments
were based on it. However I thought it was abandoned and decided not to
try to make any further generalizations to the driver for now, except
making it work with IST3032C. Should I then perhaps wait before your
series gets applied before sending v2 of my changes? Or should I send
you a patch on top of your series, where I would add the `struct
imagis_properties` for the IST3032C (which you surely could do yourself,
but I can at least test it with my device). Please let me know if and
how we should coordinate.

Please see my response to Jeff regarding this. I will be happy to hear
your thoughts on what I propose.

Kind regards,
K. B.
