There's already an API for LEDs in the kernel, why shouldn't it be used
to avoid user-space needing to know how to configure Logitech, and
every other brand of keyboards?

systemd has code to save and restore LED status, as well as code to
change the level of backlight. I can imagine that it wouldn't take much
to make it aware of RGB LEDs so it handles them properly, whether it's
for Logitech, or another brand of keyboards, or laptops.
