I did not mean do it all in userspace, but for userspace to save off
what devices are actually present. For example, if userspace has
access to the dtb, it could just update the dtb to enable the right
nodes. Then after the first boot, boot time is faster. Or a driver
could try to load an overlay with the config enabling the right
devices. Though maybe waiting til userspace is available wouldn't
speed things up.

I would not combine the 2 things. Knowing the class/type of the device
may be useful independent of your problem.

That could be useful for other things too. Like moving some of the hw
init we do outside of probe (though that's mostly abstracted to be not
DT specific, so maybe not).

drivers/soc/ or drivers/platform/ are the dumping grounds. Don't we
already have CrOS stuff there?

Okay, just making sure you weren't trying to parameterize everything
when generally, how to power sequence is implicit.

My point was that in the above example, all these delay times would
have to be defined in the kernel, not DT.

I think fixing regulators getting turned off on failed probes and
having a "regulator on time" would go a long way towards providing
that hint even if the on time was just since clocksource started.

We know the time since the clocksource was initialized. I'd imagine
for most cases, more than enough time would elapse by the time you get
to these drivers.
