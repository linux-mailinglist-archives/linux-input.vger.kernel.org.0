I was more thinking on a boolean. No need to overload the API.

Isn't trogdor (patch 10/10) already supported? Though you should be the
one making tests, so it should be fine ;)

Now that I think about it more, maybe I am too biased by USB where the
device remove would happened *after* the device has been physically
unplugged. And this doesn't apply of course in the I2C world.

Yep, I agree with you :)

Adding a separate patch would be nice, yes. Thanks!
