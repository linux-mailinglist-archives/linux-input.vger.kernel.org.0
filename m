That's not really true. The device is often in an undefined power state
and we try to make sure that the hand over is as smooth as possible to
avoid resetting displays and similar unnecessarily.

The power-on sequence is what brings the device into a defined power
state.

Even for GPIO regulators we have the "regulator-boot-on" devicetree
property which is supposed to be set if the boot firmware has left a
regulator on so that the regulator initialisation can preserve the
state.

Agreed.

As I pointed out above we already do this for any error paths before
requesting the reset line. And I also don't think we need to worry too
much about power consumption in case of errors.

But there is one case I had not considered before, and that is your gpio
regulator example but where the boot-on flag does not match the actual
regulator state.

If the supply is on and reset deasserted, but the regulator-boot-on
flag is not set, then we want to make sure that reset is asserted before
disabling the supply when requesting the regulator.

You're right. It will work in my case because of the gpiolib open-drain
implementation, but not generally.

I'll add back the reset during early probe and add error handling for
deasserting reset on machines like the X13s. On these, the touchscreen
may now be reset a couple of times in case of probe deferrals, but
device links should generally prevent that.
