I will need to defer to Ingo here, as he usually applies the EFI
changes piecemeal rather than merging my branches directly.

I'd be fine with just annotating the conflict in the pull request if
it is trivial, though, but it is really up to Luis and Ingo to align
here.

Note that I was just about to send out a PR for the second batch of
EFI changes, but there will be more this cycle in any case.
