The reason I've added these to the xHCI driver is that it works even if
you are running some really small userspace (like busybox). Also for the
xHCI in TCSS we know for sure that it fully supports D3cold.

(The one you refer above is actually mistake from my side as I never
 tested Alpine Ridge LP controller which I think this is).

This is really up to Mathias to decide. I'm fine either way :)
