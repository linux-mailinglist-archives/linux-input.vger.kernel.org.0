Doesn't `setkeycodes` affect only one keyboard? What if there are more
keyboards connected to a machine?

 From drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c:

/*
  * Translation of scancodes to keycodes. We set them on only the first
  * keyboard in the list that accepts the scancode and keycode.
  * Explanation for not choosing the first attached keyboard anymore:
  *  USB keyboards for example have two event devices: one for all "normal"
  *  keys and one for extra function keys (like "volume up", "make coffee",
  *  etc.). So this means that scancodes for the extra function keys won't
  *  be valid for the first event device, but will be for the second.

Regards,

Andrzej
