I have my reserves with such a kill switch (see below).

I don't think Werner meant unbinding the HID driver, just a toggle to
enable/disable the basic HID core processing of LampArray.

Yeah, the generic LampArray support will not be able to differentiate
"emulated" devices from native ones.

Again no, it'll be too unpredicted.

To be able to talk over hidraw you need a driver to be bound, yes. But I
had the impression that LampArray would be supported by default in
hid-input.c, thus making this hard to remove. Having a separate driver
will work, but as soon as the LampArray device will also export a
multitouch touchpad, we are screwed and will have to make a choice
between LampArray and touch...

Do we really need to entirely unregister the led class device? Can't we
snoop on the commands and get some "mean value"?

That's where your plan falls short: if OpenRGB crashes, or is killed it
will not reset that bit.

Next question: is OpenRGB supposed to keep the hidraw node opened all
the time or not?

If it has to keep it open, we should be able to come up with a somewhat
similar hack that we have with hid-steam: when the hidraw node is
opened, we disable the kernel processing of LampArray. When the node is
closed, we re-enable it.

But that also means we have to distinguish steam/SDL from OpenRGB...

I just carefully read the LampArray spec. And it's simpler than what
I expected. But the thing that caught my attention was that it's
mentioned that there is no way for the host to query the current
color/illumination of the LEDs when the mode is set to
AutonomousMode=false. Which means that the kernel should be able to
snoop into any commands sent from OpenRGB to the device, compute a mean
value and update its internal state.

Basically all we need is the "toggle" to put the led class in read-only
mode while OpenRGB kicks in. Maybe given that we are about to snoop on
the commands sent, we can detect that there is a LampArray command
emitted, attach this information to the struct file * in hidraw, and
then re-enable rw when that user closes the hidraw node.

Benjamin
