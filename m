Ack on the no new device, but since we are adding use_leds_uapi to the parent 
device anyway, having the identification on non-HID devices wie sysfs entries 
would help even more in not creating a new device just to handle an ioctl.

Just to note here. When we go the LampArray route, everything is a HID device 
anyway.

The parent device can be of any kind, like I mentioned above, and while for deactivating it can easily be found via /sys/class/leds/*/device/. For reactivating, the leds entry doesn't exist.

Ack
