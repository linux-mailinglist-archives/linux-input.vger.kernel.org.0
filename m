How many of such devices do we have? Are they all UGTablet like the
XP-PEN? Are they behaving properly on Windows without a proprietary
driver?
We can try to make the code work based on suppositions, but this is
the first time I see such a behavior, so I'd prefer fix it when I see
it rather than adding complexity in the driver where changing anything
is hard. I'm writing regression tests for that exact same purpose.

Yes. That quirk only affects the device clearly not following the
specification. Which is why it wasn't noticed that it was wrong.

Sorry but I tend to disagree. Relying on the ioctl EVIOCSKEYCODE for
tuning the behavior of a state machine is just plain wrong. When
people do that, they are doing it at the wrong level and introducing
further bugs.

The whole pen and touch HID protocols rely on a state machine. You
just can not change the meaning of it because your hardware maker
produced a faulty hardware.
The correct solution is to submit a fix here, so that everyone gets
the benefit of it. But that fix can now be a HID-BPF program, which
will be eventually integrated in the kernel tree as soon as I manage
to get enough time to work on it.

In the same way, if you remap Tip Switch to KEY-A, you won't get
clicks from your pen. Assuming you can do that with any event on any
HID device is just plain wrong.
That ioctl is OK-ish for "remapping" simple things like keys. In our
case, the whole firmware follows a state machine, so we can not change
it. It has to be remapped in a later layer, in libinput, your
compositor, or in your end user application.

Again, you convinced me that this commit was wrong. If people needs to
also use an ioctl to "fix" it, then there is something wrong.

EVIOCSKEYCODE is called by userspace *after* the kernel parsed the
device and is ready to accept events. There is no way we can make this
consistent with the event stream. If you need to call that ioctl to
fix your device, it's a bug in the kernel, and it needs to be fixed
there before being presented to the userspace.

I might buy the "invertless" devices are a thing if I can get more
data about it. So far there are only 2 of them, and they add extra
complexity in the code when we can just patch the devices to do the
right thing.

New hardware isn't supposed to be supported on an old kernel and is
not considered as a regression. However, David mentioned that the
device was "working" on 6.5.0 but broke in 6.5.8 with the patch
mentioned above. This is a regression that needs to be tackled.
Especially because it was introduced in 6.6 but backported into 6.5.

Cheers,
Benjamin
