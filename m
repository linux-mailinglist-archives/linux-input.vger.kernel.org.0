out of interest: what's your stance on regression fixes sitting in
subsystem git trees for a week or longer before being mainlined?

The quoted patch is such a case. It fixes a regression caused by a
change that made it into 6.8-rc1, but the problem afaik was only
reported on 2024-03-19, e.g. ~nine days after 6.8 was out[1]; Kenny, the
author of the fix, apparently noticed and fixed the problem a bit later
independently[2]. Jiri merged a newer version of the fix on
2024-04-03[3], which was included in -next a day later -- the Thursday
before 6.9-rc3.

The fix thus would even have gotten two days of testing in -next, if
Benjamin or Jiri would have send it your way for that pre-release. But
from Benjamin's statement quoted above it seems the fix might even make
-rc6.

That obviously heavily reduces the time the fix will be tested before
6.9 is released.

It obviously also means that 6.8.y is as of now still unfixed, as the
stable team usually only applies fixes once they landed in mainline.

Which also means that even more people ran into the problem with
6.8.y[4] or mainline even after Jiri merged the patch into the hid tree
-- and maybe some of those people wasted their time on a bisection only
to find out that a fix exists.

That sounds, ehh, sub-optimal to me. Which is why I wonder what's your
stance here, as I encounter similar situations frequently[5] -- which
sometimes is kinda demotivating. :-/

Ciao, Thorsten
