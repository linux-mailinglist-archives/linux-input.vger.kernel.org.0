I think this depends quite a bit on what kind of features we are talking 
about. Looking at this series, we have:

- hid-core changes to add new event codes / add support for these

- bfp modifications to support caching and write feature for the new 
event codes (technically they can be written already via /dev/hidraw 
directly, but the interface is bit clumsy, so we improve it with BFP)

So, depending on the feature you want to add, you can take either way, 
but probably hacking with BPF is going to be easiest. Vendor could even 
write their own BPF tool. Also, please note that the location of 
samples/bpf/hid_usi* is not going to remain, there will most likely be 
an external repository where the new HID related BPF tools are going to 
maintained, Benjamin had some thoughts about that already.
