You don't have to use systemd to use hwdb.  If you want to handle quirks
for hardware issues that are done in userspace, the overall solution for
this in Linux is hwdb.  To try to reverse that decision we all made a
long time ago is just going to duplicate work for almost no gain that I
can see.

What distros need this that can not pick this up from hwdb today?

And who is going to maintain that?  The data that ends up in hwdb
already comes from multiple places today, why add yet-another-one?  Are
you going to somehow unify all of those existing data sources into a
single entity?  Who is going to run that service and what would the end
output look like (hint, you would have to provide hwdb support, so why
not just use that?)

We don't have those today, that's not a thing.

There is no way we can ever create such a "canonical list".  Hint,
another operating system tried it, they failed, and they actually had
partnerships with most hardware vendors, and paid developers to do this
work.  What are you going to do differently than they did to solve this
problem?

But they don't overlap today, why make us do more work for no gain?
