Dear,
                       Can you trust a financial relationship that is
mutually beneficial to us both? I have received your name and contact
information from your country's banking data Information, hoping that
you are interested in what I am going to tell you.

I'm Mr. Ibrahim idewu from Ouagadougou, here in Burkina Faso. I work
for coris bank international. I am writing to you about a business
proposal that will be of great benefit to both of us. In my
department, as a banker, I discovered $19,300,000 in the account of
one of our deceased foreign clients.
The choice to contact you depends on the sensitivity of the
transaction and the confidentiality it contains. Now our bank has been
waiting for one of the family members to file the application, but
nobody has done so. Personally, I have not found family members for a
long time. I ask for permission to present you as the next of kin /
beneficiary of the deceased, so the proceeds of this account are worth
$19,300,000 to you.

This is paid or shared in these percentages, 60% for me and 40% for
you. I have secured legal documents that can be used to substantiate
this claim. The only thing I have to do is put your names in the
documents and legalize them here in court to prove you as the rightful
beneficiary. All I need now is your honest cooperation,
confidentiality and your trust, so that we can complete this
transaction. I guarantee that this transaction is 100% risk-free, as
the transfer is subject to international banking law

Please give me this as we have 5 days to work through this. This is very urgent.

1. Full Name:
2. Your direct mobile number:
3. Your contact address:
4. Your job:
5. Your nationality:
6. Your gender / age:

Please confirm your message and interest to provide further
information. Please do get back to me on time.

Best regards
Mr. Ibrahim idewu
