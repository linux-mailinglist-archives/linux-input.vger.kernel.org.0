So I was thinking sure, fine lets replace the loop with memmem,
but the kernel has no memmem, it has memscan but that takes an
int to search for, and reducing the prefix to an int seems likely
to cause more false positives and unnecessary sha256summing.

So I believe it is best to keep this as is for now, we can always
change the alignment requirement later, now that we use memcmp
to check the prefix changing it is just a matter of changing the
i += 8 to e.g. i += 4.

Regards,

Hans
