I guess it would be good to fix this in the kernel, sending
KEY_WAKEUP from gpio_key when the event is KEY_POWER and
we are going through the special wakeup path in gpio_keys.

When this was discussed quite a while ago the ACPI button
driver simply did not send any event at all on wkaeup
by ACPI power-button. Know that it does send an event
it would be good to mimic this, at least when the gpio_key
devices where instantiated by soc_button_array.

So maybe add a new field to struct gpio_keys_button
called wakeup_code and when that is not 0 use that
instead of the plain "code" member on wakeups ?

That would keep the gpio_keys code generic while
allowing to mimic the ACPI button behavior.

And then set wakeup_code to KEY_WAKEUP for
the power-button in soc_button_array.

To me this sounds better then trying to fix all userspace
code which does something on KEY_POWER of which there
is quite a lot.

The special GNOME power-button handling was always
a workaround because last time a kernel fix was
nacked. But now with the KEY_WAKEUP done by the ACPI
button code it looks like we do have a good way
to fix this in the kernel, so that would be better
IMHO.

Dmitry, what do you think of adding a wakeup_code
field to struct gpio_keys_button and let the code
creating the gpio_keys_button decide if a different
code should be used on wakeup or not ?

Regards,

Hans
