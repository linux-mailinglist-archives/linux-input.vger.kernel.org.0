Indeed, I wasn't implying that you were saying that.

I see it as more annoying, but maybe that's my workflow? When my kernel
oopses I have to go back to a recovery kernel, which takes me a few more
seconds to "repair" my device. If the driver only failed to probe then
I'd probably be able to boot far enough to get networking and more
easily replace my kernel with a working device. And I'd have userspace
access so I could poke around and figure out why the driver failed to
probe. Now obviously a big stacktrace would be helpful to know that it's
the power key driver that's busted, but it's not like we're calling some
internal API here. We're trying to probe a driver and if that oopses
because the driver writer failed at their job then it's bad on them for
writing a bad patch but also annoying for the integrator who has to deal
with the mess they created. I'd rather have a half working system here
vs. a totally broken one.
