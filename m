So I was looking for a high level 0/ boilerplate description of this 
series, to explain what "EFI embedded fw" is, what problems it solves and 
how it helps the kernel in general - and found this in 2/8:

There's also patch #3, which explains how this is used:

>> This commit adds a new platform fallback mechanism to the firmware loader
>> which will try to lookup a device fw copy embedded in the platform's main

>>

Plus there's 3 patches that opt in three drivers to this new EFI-firmware 
loading mechanism, right?

A couple of high level questions:

- How common are these kinds of firmware files that should be loaded into 
  the device by the OS device driver? Common? Or 1% of systems? 0.1% of 
  systems? 0.0001%?

- Can there be a situation where linux-firmware already includes an older 
  copy of the firmware, and the EFI firmware has a newer version? If this 
  can plausibly happen, shouldn't the fallback mechanism do some sort of 
  version check (if that's possible), and load the newer version?

- I'm worried about the explicit opt-in nature of these firmware files - 
  the OS driver has to be explicitly aware of this possibility. Shouldn't 
  we at minimum have some sort of boot time check to see whether a device 
  has an embedded fw blob, and warn the user if we don't actually load 
  it? Which would generate some gentle pressure to fix our drivers?

- I think the config option should be default-y, because AFAICS this 
  mechanism makes broken drivers/devices work.

- Finally, is there any question of trust or a potential for other 
  security pitfalls here, where we'd trust linux-firmware over what the 
  EFI firmware says is the proper firmware for a device? My default 
  assumption would be that we are exposed to the EFI firmware anyway, and 
  it comes with the hardware just like the devices come with the 
  hardware, so we can generally trust it. But I might be missing 
  something. If there's any plausible question of trust (for example can 
  attackers hide rooted firmware in the EFI image, without triggering 
  filesystem integrity checks on the regular filesystem side?) then it 
  might make sense to offer a boot parameter to disable this, beyond the 
  config parameter.

Thanks,

	Ingo
