Thanks for the explanation!

I own a GANSS keyboard which encounters this issue as well, related device
information given by `lsusb -v` below:

    idVendor           0x05ac Apple, Inc.
    idProduct          0x024f Aluminium Keyboard (ANSI)
    iManufacturer           1 SONiX
    iProduct                2 USB DEVICE

As I searching through, I found similar reports regarding another GANSS
model[1], and other brands like Varmilo[2] (a lot!) and Keychron. As a
common pattern, they mostly use 05ac:024f.

Currently I have two idea:

1. Modify Bryan's patch, so that fnmode default to 2 if device name not
starting with "Apple" (But I can't validate my assumption since I don't
own any Apple keyboards), I'll attach this patch in the next email.

2. Find out which quirk pattern solves this issue brute-forcely, I may
attach this patch later when I finally find a solution.

What's your opinion?

Stay boiled,
Hilton Chain
