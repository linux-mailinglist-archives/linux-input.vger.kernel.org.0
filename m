Dear,
How is everything today,I am widow with a child who is 7 years old. 
Pressure from my family has compelled me to seek for your assistance. 
Can you help me receive $10.5 Million in your account, this money is for 
investment into real estate, I don't want to lose this fund as pressure 
on me with life threatening is becoming unbearable. Since the death of 
my husband, his brothers have been seriously chasing me around with 
constant threats, trying to suppress me so that they might have the 
documents of his landed properties and they have confiscate them. Please 
can I confide in you, I will give you more details once you reply back. 
my number is: +22990078315
Thanks,
Julian David
