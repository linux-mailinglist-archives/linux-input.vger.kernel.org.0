I see your point.

So what you envision is SysRq key being configured for each input device
separately. I can see these problems:

- How to attach such a configuration information to each specific
device instance? It is easy if done framework-wise, but gets messy
if done per-device. And we are talking per-device rather than per-driver.

- If a user has multiple USB keyboards connected (possibly through a cascade
of hubs), how would they know which key is valid for which keyboard?

Wouldn't it be better if such a piece of configuration were valid for the
whole system instead of per-device?
